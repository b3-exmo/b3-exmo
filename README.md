## Read it [here](https://b3-exmo.github.io/)!

These are personal notes on deconstructing a religious upbringing taken in an application called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Those notes are then published here in Github Pages, using a web app template, [obsidian-publish-mkdocs](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs). Check it out to make one yourself!
