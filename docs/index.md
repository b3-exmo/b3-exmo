# ⛪ LDS Notes

I call myself Bee-cubed. Growing up in the LDS church has shaped my worldview. At one point in late 2018, I encountered information that upended that worldview, and have since been engaging in a deconstruction process. This is a compendium of my notes and findings amid that deconstruction.

## Why, though?
I didn’t wake up one day, and decide to tear down my worldview.

I want this to be true. I never missed a day of seminary, I went on a mission, I got married in the temple, I even got a recommend to be a temple worker in Provo.

I didn’t resolve to upend my eternal perspective, and throw away a core part of my identity. I want the LDS teachings to be true.

Many of these issues have conflicting amounts of weight behind them. I don’t have concrete evidence against all LDS teaching, nor is there solid, undeniable evidence in favor of it. The church could disambiguate and clear up all confusion, but it does not. Presumably, because you and I are meant to rely on faith.

For more information on this, I have a page outlining [[My own experience]].

Some could retain their optimism thanks to [Alma 32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) — “faith is . . . hope for things which are not seen, **which are true**.” Faith is not insistence on things which are not seen, despite evidence to the contrary. That is not faith.

## History

How can we know the accuracy of historical claims?

- Are they falsifiable?
- Do multiple, independent, contemporary sources make the same claim?
- Do any claimants have motivated reasoning or a stake in a claim’s veracity?
- How close is the recording date to the date of the claimed event? Or, how much time has passed before someone wrote down this event?

Each of these metrics that a claim fails to make weakens that argument.

There are not many contemporary sources for ancient Greek history. Ancient Greeks have been known to add mythological aspects to their history. Therefore, it should be taken with some healthy skepticism and critical evaluation.

The US civil war has myriad contemporary sources. We can be fairly confident in piecing together what happened, given the abundance of independent sources making the same claims.

Historical claims made by the LDS church rarely meet these criteria. That does not mean that all of its claims are false, it only necessitates healthy skepticism and critical evaluation.

### Not History
Please understand, it’s not only problematic history.

It’s also how the top 15 in the church act.
It’s social issues.

More specifically, it's how the Church that claims to be led by Christ doesn't fit His behavior very well. 

## Your response

If your answer to these notes is to tell me to read and pray about it, then we having nothing left to discuss on this matter. Please, please don’t assume that I haven’t done that. I have read and prayed. The last 3 times I went to the temple, I went with these concerns in mind, imploring God for any explanation or answer. I’ve read the Book of Mormon upwards of 6 times amid the deconstruction. I've put in enough effort to have received a spiritual witness. 

**I'm not counting myself as an expert in anything— I simply have an internet connection.**

## What's next?
Good news— I've got a [[TODO]] for documents to outline what topics to cover next, along with which documents are slated for additional polish.
