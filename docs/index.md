# ⛪ LDS Notes

I call myself Bee-cubed. Growing up in the LDS church has shaped my worldview. At one point in late 2018, I encountered information that upended that worldview, and have since been engaging in a deconstruction process. This is a compendium of my notes and findings amid that deconstruction.

I don't think of this as a journal or blog. I'll interject a time or two, or share how a topic relates to me, but broadly speaking, these notes are observations on truth claims, disagreeable policies, and historical novelties. I'll make an effort to cite sources, and provide links for further reading.

## Why, though?
I didn’t wake up one day, and decide to tear down my worldview.

I want this to be true. I never missed a day of seminary, I went on a mission, I got married in the temple, I even got a recommend to be a temple worker in Provo. I did **not** resolve to upend my eternal perspective, and throw away a core part of my identity. *I want the LDS teachings to be true.*

Many of these issues have conflicting amounts of weight behind them. I don’t have concrete evidence against all LDS teaching, nor is there solid, undeniable evidence in favor of it. The church could disambiguate and clear up all confusion, but it does not. Presumably, because you and I are meant to rely on faith. By every Mormon's [favorite scriptural passage](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p21#p21), “faith is . . . hope for things which are not seen, **which are true**.” Faith is not stubborn insistence despite evidence to the contrary.

For more information on this, I have a page outlining [[My own experience]].
### History

How can we know the accuracy of historical claims? Here are some qualifications to look for in any historical claim, religious or not:

- Are they falsifiable?
- Do multiple, independent, contemporary sources make the same claim?
- Do any claimants have motivated reasoning or a stake in a claim’s veracity?
- How close is the recording date to the date of the event? Or, how much time has passed before someone wrote down this event?

A historical claim that fails to answer these questions is subject to more scrutiny. Each of these metrics that a claim fails to meet weakens its argument.

There are not many contemporary sources for ancient Greek history. Ancient Greeks have been known to add mythological aspects to their history. Therefore, it should be taken with some healthy skepticism and critical evaluation.

The US civil war has myriad contemporary sources. We can be fairly confident in piecing together what happened, given the abundance of independent sources making the same claims.

Historical claims made by the LDS church rarely meet these criteria. That does not mean that all of its claims are false, it only necessitates healthy skepticism and critical evaluation.

**I'm not counting myself as an expert in anything— I simply have an internet connection.**

### Modern leadership
Please understand, it’s not only problematic history.

It’s also how the top 15 in the church behave. It’s social issues. More specifically, it's how the Church that claims to be led by Christ doesn't fit His behavior very well. Jesus had some choice words for those who would exclude those who were already outcasts. Jesus didn't turn folks away for being part of a different demographic. Jesus didn't leverage legal power to buy silence or force non-disclosure agreements.

## Your response
If your answer to these notes is to tell me to read more scriptures and pray about it, then we having nothing to discuss on this matter. Please, please don’t assume that I haven’t done that. I have read and prayed. The last 3 times I went to the temple, I went with these concerns in mind, imploring God for any explanation or answer. I’ve read the Book of Mormon upwards of 6 times amid the deconstruction. I've put in enough effort to have received a spiritual witness. 

### Where to start?

You'll find a column on the left side of this webpage to help navigate how my notes are organized. Pick a topic that interests you. Or, if you don't have a starting point in mind, I'd direct you to notes on [[True|truth]], an overview of the [[Book of Mormon/index|Book of Mormon]], comments on [[DC 132|D&C Section 132]], or how the LDS faith views the [[Bible]].

This is an ongoing work. I've got a [[TODO]] for documents to outline what topics to cover next, along with which documents are slated for additional polish. This is all hosted via Github Pages, which [keeps track of changes and additions](https://github.com/b3-exmo/b3-exmo.github.io/commits/main/) over time. It's not quite an approachable changelog, but you're welcome to examine how the notes have developed over time.

If I've configured things properly, there's a comment section on each page. I don't like sounding like a Youtuber pleading for engagement metrics, but if something you've read here resonates with you, I'd find intrinsic value in your thoughts, agreeable or not.
