# ✝️ Christianity
## Time

> *Let’s say that the consensus is that our species, we being the higher primates, has been on the planet for at least 100,000 years, maybe more. Francis Collins says 100,000, Richard Dawkins thinks a quarter-of-a-million. I’ll take 100,000…*
>
> *In order to be a Christian you have to believe that for 98,000 years, our species suffered and died, most of its children dying in childbirth, most other people having a life expectancy of about 25 years, dying of their teeth. Famine, struggle, bitterness, war, suffering, misery.*
>
> *All of that for 98,000 years, Heaven watches this with complete indifference. Then 2000 years ago, thinks, ‘That’s enough of that, it’s time to intervene.’ And the best way to do this would be by condemning someone to a human sacrifice somewhere in the less literate parts of the Middle East. Don’t let’s appeal to the Chinese, for example, where people can read and study evidence and have a civilization - no, let’s go to the desert and have another revelation there.*
>
> *This is nonsense; it can’t be believed by a thinking person.*

— Christopher Hitchens (probably)

I've encountered this quote in isolation a few times ([1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1572150/characters/nm0386899), [2](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/919133-let-s-say-that-the-consensus-is-that-our-species-being), [3](https://hitchensdebates.blogspot.com/2010/07/hitchens-vs-wilson-kings-college.html)) but I've not yet seen a primary source for it.

## Scale
The universe is huge, like really, incredibly, un-fucking-believably huge. The idea that any creature capable of creating and managing the whole of creation would care about something as cosmically insignificant as our galaxy, much less our specific planet and it’s myopic inhabitants, isn’t just arrogant, its outrageous and insane.

The more I thought about it, the more I concluded that, should any being or entity capable of forging our reality exist, we wouldn’t _want_ it’s attention. Would it even perceive us as alive? It would see us the way we see bacteria, if even with that level of respect. I don’t believe there is a creator, but if there is, I think I’d prefer to avoid it’s gaze or awareness.

Put this further in perspective to the context of Mormonism; supreme creator of the universe would be _unfathomably_ petty to have created our universe, and gets exceptionally pissy if you do specific things:

- Don’t say [[Name Mormon|Mormon]]
- Don’t drink coffee
- I (God) made you gay or with body dysmorphia; how dare you “act on it”, for whatever actions that leads to

> **Why do people get angry when I try to share the word of God with them? I only do it because I care about them deeply and don’t want them to end up in hell. I feel like some people avoid me because of this. Is there any way to get through to them?**

> The entire process is not what you think it is.
> 
> It is specifically designed to be uncomfortable for the other person because it isn’t about converting them to your religion. It is about manipulating you so you can’t leave yours.
> 
> If this tactic was about converting people it would be considered a horrible failure. It recruits almost no one who isn’t already willing to join. Bake sales are more effective recruiting tools.
> 
> On the other hand, it is extremely effective at creating a deep tribal feeling among its own members.
> 
> The rejection they receive is actually more important than the few people they convert. It causes them to feel a level of discomfort around the people they attempt to talk to. These become the “others”. These uncomfortable feelings go away when they come back to their congregation, the “Tribe”.
> 
> If you take a good look at the process it becomes fairly clear. In most cases, the religious person starts out from their own group, who is encouraging and supportive. They are then sent out into the harsh world where people repeatedly reject them. Mainly because they are trained to be so annoying.
> 
> These brave witnesses then return from the cruel world to their congregation where they are treated like returning heroes. They are now safe. They bond as they share their experiences of reaching out to the godless people to bring them the truth. They share the otherness they experience.
> 
> Once again they will learn that the only place they are accepted is with the people who think as they do. It isn’t safe to leave the group. The world is your enemy, but we love you.
> 
> This is a pain reward cycle that is a common brainwashing technique. The participants become more and more reliant on the “Tribe” because they know that “others” reject them.
> 
> Mix in some ritualized chanting, possibly a bit of monotonous repetition of instructions, add a dash of fear of judgment by an unseen, but all-powerful entity who loves you if you do as you are told and you get a pretty powerful mix.
> 
> Sorry, I have absolutely no wish to participate in someone’s brainwashing ritual.
