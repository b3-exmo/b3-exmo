# üíí D&C 132

## [D&C 132](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng)

Structure of these notes got kind of wonky. The content is still there, but not as easily navigable.
### This is still canon scripture somehow

Topical Guide entry for [New & Everlasting Covenant](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/new-and-everlasting-covenant?lang=eng)

Not copying the entire section here, just some excerpts.
### Heading

> Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet . . . relating to the new and everlasting covenant, including the eternity of the marriage covenant and ==the principle of plural marriage==.

### Verse 4

> For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and ==if ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned==; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.

Why would we dress it up and call it the new and everlasting covenant if it wasn‚Äôt a code term? There‚Äôs already a word for it. Marriage. English grammar allows us to put a qualifying adjective before it; Eternal Marriage is self-explanatory enough that it doesn‚Äôt need a code phrase, because Plural Marriage (explicitly stated in the section header; also self-explanatory) just doesn‚Äôt sound so innocuous

There wasn‚Äôt a recognized term for religious sanction on polygamy. Gotta call it _something_ or else we‚Äôll look like a sex cult.

### Verse 7

> And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these: All covenants . . . that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise . . . by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and ==there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred)==, are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.

Only one person on the earth can do this‚Ä¶? Can sanctify a marriage to be eternal, or justify polygamy?

‚ÄúThis is very important; only JS can do this, it‚Äôs that special.‚Äù Gotcha.

### Verse 12

> I am the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment‚Äîthat no man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith the Lord.

If this is a tangent, not fitting the context of polygamy, then‚Ä¶ what is it doing here? This has been iterated enough times already. Is it safe to assume the context of this verse is applicable to polygamy? No man comes to the Father unless they are polygamous?

### Verse 15 - 17

> Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world.

> Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.

> For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth ==are not gods, but are angels of God== forever and ever.

Sounds like these verses are in favor of the new & everlasting covenant being simply and exclusively eternal marriage.

Rather, those who do not get married by authority **will not become gods** but will be single, unmarried angels.

### Verse 18

> And again, verily I say unto you, ==if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or by my word, which is my law==, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord. . . .

Whoops, what‚Äôs this? We can make a covenant with our spouse for eternity outside the purview of priesthood authority? That‚Äôs an explicitly stated use case here.

This makes me think that the new & everlasting covenant is not simply and exclusively eternal marriage.

### Verse 19

> And again, verily I say unto you, ==if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant==, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them‚ÄîYe shall come forth in the first resurrection; . . . to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.

‚ÄúIf they get married (and they should,) and do it ‚Äòby the new and everlasting covenant‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù

The semantics of this clause also makes me think that the new & everlasting covenant is not simply and exclusively marriage.

### Verses 20 - 21

> ==Then shall they be gods==, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. ==Then shall they be gods==, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.

> Verily, verily, I say unto you, ==except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory==.*

Idk man, I was always told that Mormons becoming Gods wasn‚Äôt canon. How did I miss this?

### Verse 33

> But if ye enter not into my law ye cannot receive the promise of my Father, which he made unto Abraham.

Can‚Äôt get into heaven unless you do it.

### Verse 38

> ==David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants==, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and ==in nothing did they sin== save in those things which they received not of me.

Quick side note:

> Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.
[Jacob 2:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)

Which is it? These verses are talking about the same thing and are in direct conflict.

### Verse 47

> And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless I will bless, and whomsoever you curse I will curse, saith the Lord; for I, the Lord, am thy God.

No room for abuse of power here, nope

‚ÄúEverything I do, God does. What I will to happen is God‚Äôs will.‚Äù

Shouldn‚Äôt this be the other way around? The prophet does God‚Äôs will?

This is an endorsement, this is committing to back up anything the mortal leader does. JS‚Äô actions have God‚Äôs unconditional seal of approval.

### Verses 51 - 52

> Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give unto mine handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, ==that she stay herself and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her==; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an offering at your hand, by covenant and sacrifice.

> And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God.

51: I‚Äôve seen an unsubstantiated claim that this is referring to Emma being offered to have extramarital relations to ‚Äúget even‚Äù with Joseph, hoping it would even the score, so she‚Äôll get off his back about polygamy. Go hook up with William Law.

52: ‚ÄúGod said you have to shut up and accept my extra plural wives. So there.‚Äù

### Verse 54

> And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for ==I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law==.

‚ÄúThus saith God: Joseph, your wife needs to stop being a bitch and shut up.‚Äù

### Verse 56

> And again, verily I say, ==let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses==; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her, and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice.

What trespasses?

At face value, this sounds passive aggressive, condescending to Emma who perceives the attempts at polygamy as trespasses. This is speculation, but ~~God~~ Joseph seems to be deflecting saying he has to be forgiven, because ‚Äúwell Emma not like you haven‚Äôt been pristine-perfect either ü§ì‚Äù

### Verses 61 - 63

> And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood‚Äî==if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another==, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, ==then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him==; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else.

> And if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore is he justified.

> But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth. . .

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS

IT IS STILL CANON

STILL PUBLISHED AND DISTRIBUTED

One could make the argument that ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù could mean ‚Äúyoung girl irrespective of sexual encounters‚Äù, much like it does in biblical times? That argument, if valid, can also go against the idea of immaculate conception.

### Verse 64

> And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this power, and ==he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these things==, then shall she believe and administer unto him, ==or she shall be destroyed==, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law.*

‚Äúpertaining to these things‚Äù appended to ‚Äúthe law of my priesthood‚Äù in this section makes me think that the law of priesthood is another phrase to describe polygamy.

‚ÄúOr she shall be destroyed‚Äù hmm ok sure

Are we going to spin this and say being destroyed doesn‚Äôt mean being destroyed?

### Verse 65

> Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, ==if she receive not this law==, for him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, ==because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor==. . .

With God‚Äôs seal of approval from verse 47, there‚Äôs no way for me to know at this point if it‚Äôs Joseph or God dictating this verse.

[D&C 1:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1?lang=eng&id=p38#p38): _whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same._

Huh. Well I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter, then.
