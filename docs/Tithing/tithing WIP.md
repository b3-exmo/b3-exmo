## Vs Walmart

Given the claims of $100b hedge fund, this isn’t even 1%.

Ensign Peak Advisors, the investment management branch of LDS church, gets around 7% ROI.

Excluding all tithing, they generate $20m per day. Takes them less than a week to recover that generous donation KSL listed.

Walmart will back up their claims on $1.08 billion per year, outlining where it goes and itemizing how the donations are used.

Please don’t make the claim that the LDS church is a charitable organization with those figures.
## Culture

Tithing was not a requirement to enter the temple until 1968.

**1856** – Temple recommend questions. The First Presidency sent a letter stating that those recommended by local leaders should:

> be those who pray, who pay their tithing from year to year; who live the lives of saints from day to day; setting good examples before their neighbors. Men and women, boys and girls over 16 years of age who are living the lives of saints, believer in the plurality [plural marriage], and do not speak evil of the authorities of the Church, and possess true integrity towards their friends _(Spring 1998._ History of LDS Temple Admission Standards. _The Journal of Mormon History._ _135-175)_.


**1886** – The First Presidency instructed, among other things, that it is “inconsistent to carry the smell of whiskey and tobacco into the sacred precincts of the Lord’s House” (Spring 1998. _History of LDS Temple Admission Standards_. The Journal of Mormon History. 135-175).

Tithing was made a requirement for a temple recommend at about the same time, if not in the same letter.


**1899** – [Lorenzo Snow went on a tithing raising tour throughout southern Utah](http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?locale=0&sourceId=023ba41f6cc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&vgnextoid=198bf4b13819d110VgnVCM1000003a94610aRCRD). Tithing was reemphasized for temple attendance (St. George temple, Logan Temple, and Salt Lake temple were the only ones in operation at this time).


**1934 –**  _“It is important that all those who may desire to enter the temple for endowments or other ordinances, should observe the law of tithing. The applicant should also observe all other principles of the Gospel, should keep the Word of Wisdom, not use profanity, should not join nor be a member of any secret oath-bound organization and should sustain without reservation the general and local authorities of the church.” (Handbook of Instructions 1934)_

**1928** – General Handbook of Instructions says that tithing should be encouraged by bishops for those wishing to attend the temple. [http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V14N03_80.pdf](http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V14N03_80.pdf)


**1933** – General Handbook makes tithing non-optional, requiring prior observance of the principle of tithing as well as:  

> The applicant should also observe all other principles of the Gospel, should keep the Word of Wisdom, not use profanity, should not join nor be a member of any secret oath bound organization and should sustain without reservation the general and local authorities of the church. [http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V14N03_80.pdf](http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V14N03_80.pdf)


**1941** – [Recommend questions (link broken)](http://www.mormonmentality.org/2008/08/23/1941-temple-recommend-form-questions.htm).

> “[Recommends] are not to be issued to persons who do not sustain the General Authorities of the Church; who are not honest tithepayers or who do not undertake to become honest tithepayers, as distinguished from part tithepayers or token payers; who do not observe the Word of Wisdom or express a willingness to undertake to observe the Word of Wisdom; and who are not otherwise fully worthy by believing in and living the gospel…” ([Handbook of Instructions, 1944](http://upwardthought.blogspot.com/2013/11/a-history-of-temple-recommend-interview.html))




The earliest “worthiness” assessments were based on a personal relationship with Joseph Smith (and later, a personal endorsement based on a relationship with one’s local leaders). Due to mission assignments and other church business, not even all the apostles were endowed (Sidney Ridgon was out of state, drumming up support for a presidential run when the Nauvoo temple was completed). Initially, no single people were endowed. It was only done for those who were married (whether in a polygamous or monogamous marriage).

In 1844, it was clarified that those who had contributed tithing money to the temple fund would have first claim to their endowment.



In 1921, a big shift occurred when the Word of Wisdom made its first appearance in the temple recommend questions, specifically calling out abstinence from coffee and tea. In 1928, there was a note that observing the principle of tithing should be “encouraged.” It was not spelled out as an absolute requirement at this time, although even from the beginning, tithe contributors were given preferment.



That same year, the language around leaders was modified to state that candidates should “sustain without reservation the general and local authorities of the church.” This language was kept until 1976. The standard around tithing was upgraded to state that recommend holders should “observe” the law of tithing. The question about profanity was dropped, although it was still mentioned as something bishops should consider.



Tithing came even later as a requirement (rather than encouragement to commit to it), in 1968.

This isn't one of the cited sources, but an interaction comes to mind of one "rich young ruler" who asks Jesus what he needed to do to enter the kingdom of heaven. After being told that he needs to sell goods and help the poor, this ruler "went away sorrowing" ([1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/19?lang=eng&id=p22#p22), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)). As far as the scriptural account goes, that's the end of the story. Maybe he took some time to consider Jesus' counsel before ultimately following it? Can't say for sure.
