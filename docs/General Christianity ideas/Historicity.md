Christianity and science don’t always get along nicely.

## Cavemen
**Joseph Fielding Smith** (_Quorum of the Twelve_)

> It was not until man forsook the divine guidance which the Lord was always willing to extend to him, that retrogression set in. The “cave-man” and the savage are products of transgression and sin; for, in the beginning man was intelligent, and directed by light and truth, even by the Savior, Jesus Christ, who is the Mediator between man and God….
>
> MEN BECAME SAVAGES THROUGH RETROGRESSION. It was not until after man rebelled and rejected the word of God that he fell into mental degeneracy, and lost the power to converse in written language. Man was intelligent in the beginning, and understood many fundamental truths, but when he refused to receive divine guidance, the Spirit of the Lord withdrew, and then he was left alone and became a savage, for the light in him was turned to darkness. 

(_Doctrines of Salvation_, 1:148-149)

**Mark E. Petersen** (_Quorum of the Twelve_)

> How do we explain “cave man” and “early man” and “stone age man”? They are simply a result of deterioration and retrogression. They fell away from a better life, that which was known to the first man, Adam.

(_Adam: Who Is He?_ p.53)

> When did civilization start?
>
> It began with Adam, the first man, unusually well educated because the Lord was his teacher. (Moses 6.) It is admitted that there was retrogression among some of his family who apostatized and then left his well-ordered society. They were the backsliders who left the true faith and culture of Adam and the patriarchs and sank so low that they became carnal, sensual, and devilish.
>
> “And Satan came among them, saying: I am also a son of God; and he commanded them, saying: Believe it not; and they believed it not, and they loved Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish.” (Moses 5:13. See also D&C 20:20.)
>
> Thus they became the cavemen and other early degenerates who some scholars now mistakenly believe were the first men.
>
> All of this differs but little from situations found among certain aborigines who live today in some parts of the world. Both the caveman-type and the advanced man of our present culture still live today, as examples of the contrast between human retrogression on one hand and cultural advancement on the other.
>
> Since this is happening today, can anyone say that the condition did not also exist 5,000 or 6,000 years ago? 

(_Moses: Man of Miracles_, p.8-9)

&nbsp;

> Adam and Eve knew God personally. They saw him and talked with him. They were taught the gospel of Jesus Christ even in that early time–which was long before the Lords earthly ministry, for Jesus had been appointed to be the Savior during our premortal existence.
> 
> The plan of salvation, therefore, was instituted among these first human beings, Adam and Eve and their children. Angels taught them. The family believed. They were baptized and began to serve God. (See Moses 5.)
> 
> The scriptures say that as Adam tilled the ground and cared for the cattle and the sheep, Eve “did labor with him” (Moses 5:1).
> 
> They were highly intelligent people, not at all like either the hominids or the cavemen some claim the first humans to have been. They were well educated, having been taught by the Lord himself. What an education! What an instructor!
> 
> Think of it, and remember that the glory of God is intelligence, or in other words, light and truth (D&C 93:36). These gifts were imparted to Adam and Eve and their family. No one else could teach them, because they were the first human beings. That task was left to the Lord and his angels….
> 
> It was a glorious period—until Satan came among them. That evil person defied the teachings of God and said to the children of Adam, “Believe it not,” and from that time some of the family loved Satan more than God (see Moses 5:13). They apostatized from the truth.
> 
> These dissenters lost the Spirit of God and as a result became carnal, sensual, and devilish (see Moses 5:13). With these evil attributes always comes retrogression. We should not be surprised, therefore, to hear of cavemen living in the dawn of time.

**Bruce R. McConkie** (_Quorum of the Twelve_)

>Speaking of the degrees of civilization and decency found within nations in successive ages, it is clear that there have been instances of great national devolution or degeneracy. The American Indians, in their tribal and degenerate state, were the descendants of the highly civilized Nephite civilization that prevailed on the American continent for nearly 200 years after the ministry of Christ in the Western Hemisphere. So-called cave men and the like were all degenerate descendants of the highly civilized men who peopled the earth beginning with Adam, the father of civilization.
