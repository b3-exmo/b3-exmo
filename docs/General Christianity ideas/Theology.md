# Theology
## LDS God
According to LDS doctrine:

- Elohim created all of our spirits, but he did such a bad job, 1/3 didn't pass quality control and couldn't progress to stage two of creation.
- This life (stage two) is a test, so Elohim wiped our memories beforehand so we wouldn't remember the correct answers.
- Elohim then sent Lucifer and the 1/3 failed spirits down to Earth to confuse us and lead as many astray as possible.
- But Elohim really does want us to believe in him, so he withholds all demonstrable evidence and requires that we rely on logical fallacies and coincidences. This includes feelings that must be interpreted as telepathic communications from your divine creator living on an exalted planet tens of thousands of light years away, not known demonstrable chemical processes occurring in your brain (which brain He designed and created.)
- Elohim's plan: Have his only perfect son murdered so he could convince himself to forgive you for failing the test and then use the blood of the Jesus to save you from failing! As long as you ritualistically pretend to drink his blood and eat his flesh every week, pay the club dues, obey your leaders, and covenant to give everything you have including your own life to one specific church. But if you don't like that plan, prison is waiting for you on the other side. But wait, there's more! While you're in prison, someone in a temple will be performing nonconsensual rituals for you so you can choose while a gun is pointed at your head to accept Elohim's plan and enter a lower tier peasant heaven for second class citizens! You'll still be looked down on for eternity, but hey, at least you're not in prison!
- After everything is said and done, the success rate of Elohim's plan will be significantly below 1%. He's all-knowing and knows how to do a better job, but clearly doesn't want to.

If it's all true, then Elohim is either the most incompetent god or the most evil god in all of mythology. Either way, he's not worthy of my time or consideration.

Don’t forget that even after passing the test, not letting demons sway you into doing bad things like drinking hot bean water, paying club dues for life, etc., you also gotta learn the right handshakes to enter to go back to live with your dad. Hope you’ve been wearing right kind of underwear!

God *requires* justice, but can't bring himself to forgive outright. So, he needs a *blood offering* to be happy with us.

Think of that. The God of Christianity requires suffering for sins, and we're made to sin. We're imperfect enough that it's inevitable. God made us this way! He requires blood to be happy with his creations!
