# ðŸ‘Ž Falsifiability

Apologies in advance if these examples sound condescending or reductive. I'm using them for illustrative purposes to make sure we're on the same page, you and I.

## What is it?

> *A [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory "Scientific theory") or [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis") is **falsifiable** (or **refutable**) if it can be logically contradicted by an [empirical test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_test "Empirical test").*

â€” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability

&nbsp;

> *[F]or something to be called scientific, there must be a way to show it could be incorrect. Imagine youâ€™re saying you have an invisible, noiseless, pet dragon in your room that no one can touch or see. If no one can test to see if the dragon is really there, then itâ€™s not scientific. But if you claim that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level, we can test this. If it turns out water does not boil at this temperature under these conditions, then the claim would be proven false.*

The illustration of the ethereal pet dragon in the above snippet sounds like a reference to [the dragon in my garage](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Dragon_in_My_Garage#Overview_of_the_analogy), a demonstration attributed to Carl Sagan, outlined in his 1995 book *The Demon-Haunted World*. I haven't read it, but I've heard this example mentioned in a few other places. For brevity's sake, I won't copy the analogy here, but you ought to check that link!

Sagan is also attributed with saying "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." I'm inclined to agree.

## Why is it important?
If a claim can be refuted, or proven "false", it carries more value.

If the contents of the Book of Abraham were found in scrolls found in a sarcophagus sold to Joseph Smith, that's a big deal. The idea that Joseph acquired those and accurately translated them to uncover more prophetic teachings is a [[Logical fallacies#Sagan Standard|significant claim]]. Some, but not all of the extant documents still exist, and can be examined by independent third parties.

This independent examination could go one of two ways:

1. Joseph Smith nailed that translation; for him to happen upon those scrolls is nothing short of divine intervention, and those teachings prove Mormonism to be true.
2. The Book of Abraham has absolutely nothing to do with the contents of those scrolls, which modern scholars can reliably, accurately, demonstrably translate. This calls into question other claims that the LDS church made.

The significance to focus on here is the idea that the claim can be verifiably true, or verifiably false.

&nbsp;

The Book of Mormon was translated from golden plates, preserved by Moroni. You'll just have to take Joseph's word that the plates existed, since you're not allowed to see them. There's a testimony of three and also eight witnesses, they saw it. Maybe.

Joseph Smith saw God and Jesus. No one else was there, but it's an event of significant impact and consequence. Despite how world-changing this was, Joseph didn't write it down for 14 years (oops ðŸ¤ª). Definitely happened, though.

### Moving goalposts 
If you change the criteria of verifying a claim, anything can be true!

You want to examine the golden plates containing the original Book of Mormon text? The plates are gone now. Also they were written in [reformed Egyptian](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p32-p33#p32), which totally exists. It's not in Hebrew, which could be cross-examined. You can't do any carbon dating, chemical analysis, linguistic study of this extraordinary language or anthropological examination with the only bit of hard evidence that is said to have survived.

You're upset that the Book of Abraham scrolls don't appear to have anything to do with Abraham? Well, there were other scrolls in the set, and *those* ones were written by Abraham. Or maybe none of it was a direct translation, and the funerary texts for a pedestrian regular guy acted as a catalyst for Joseph to receive the scripture through revelation. It's fine.

The Garden of Eden was in Jackson County Missouri? Well, it was geographically small, secretive, and it disappeared to test our faith. No way to prove that it *isn't* in Missouri, so it has to be true.

A global flood during Noah's prophetic leadership? Well, it wasn't *actually* global, and... uh... counter-evidence is just there to test our faith.
