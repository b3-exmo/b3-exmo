# ðŸ‘Ž Falsifiability

Apologies in advance if these examples sound condescending or reductive. I'm using them for illustrative purposes to make sure we're on the same page, you and I.

> A [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory "Scientific theory") or [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis") is **falsifiable** (or **refutable**) if it can be _logically_ contradicted by an [empirical test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_test "Empirical test").

> . . . the only way to verify a claim such as "All swans are white" would be if one could theoretically observe all swans, which is not possible. Instead, falsifiability searches for the anomalous instance, such that observing a single black swan is theoretically reasonable and sufficient to logically falsify the claim.

Falsifiable and verifiable are two different things:
* "There is a unicorn" is verifiable but not falsifiable. 
* "All unicorns are white" is falsifiable but not verifiable. 

If a claim can be refuted, or proven "false", it carries more value.
