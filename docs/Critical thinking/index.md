> *The honest investigator must be prepared to follow wherever the search of truth may lead. Truth is often found in the most unexpected places. He must, with fearless and open mind insist that facts are more important than any cherished, mistaken beliefs, no matter how unpleasant the facts or how delightful the beliefs.*

Hugh B Brown, 2nd Counselor in the First Presidency, [General Conference, October **1962**](https://archive.org/details/conferencereport1962sa/page/n43/mode/2up)

Side note: Lds website only shows general conferences back to 1971. Why?

>*And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the elders of his church, and let us reason together, that ye may understand;*
>
>*Let us reason even as a man reasoneth one with another face to face.*
>
>*Now, when a man reasoneth he is understood of man, because he reasoneth as a man; even so will I, the Lord, reason with you that you may understand.*

  [D&C 50:10-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50?lang=eng&id=p10-p12#p10)
