# Logical Fallacies
Fallacies are problems with how an argument is constructed. They say nothing about why a conclusion is wrong, other than to say that the conclusion came from a bad argument. Bad arguments can still lead to conclusions that are true.

In other words, once we're done labeling the arguments, one also should consider explaining why the conclusions are shit, too.

==I am not exempt from these!== Please, point out where I use logical fallacies so I can fix / revisit the arguments. I've added a comment section to these notes for exactly that purpose.

A more comprehensive document would delineate these into formal vs informal fallacies. I'm not doing that here. You can go down that rabbit hole on your own time.

## Fallacies

A primer:
**"Absence of evidence**" = There is no evidence present. No evidence has been found. For example: There is no evidence that pink unicorns exist." This does not strictly mean that the argument is impossible, simply that there is no evidence.

**"Evidence of absence"** = Found evidence demonstrating that something was there but is now missing or gone. For example: "The dust on the mantel shows that the clock has been removed." Evidence of absence is indeed evidence.

These are different, and one does not follow from the other.
### Ad Hominem
Criticizing a person making the argument rather than the argument itself. 

Ex: “Because John is a former Mormon, an apostate from the LDS Church, his argument against the Book of Abraham cannot be considered valid.”

See also: [[#No true Scottsman]]

### Argument from Emotional Experience
If you seriously think, meditate, or pray about a claim and you have a salient emotional reaction, the claim is most likely true.

Example: The more I thought about it, the more I felt that Sarah really is madly in love with me and her saying "please stop texting me" is her way of processing her emotions.

### Argument from Faith
If you want to know if a claim is true or not, you have to try _just believing_ that it's true.

Example: Quija boards prove that Ghosts are real, but Ghosts don't talk to people through Quija boards unless those people sincerely believe that ghosts are real.

### Argument from Incompleteness
because competing claims lack sufficient completeness, my claim is equally valid and reasonable.

Example: "(pretend it's the 1990s) The Jury is still out on whether or not smoking causes cancer, so I see nothing wrong with smoking 2 packs a day."

### Argument from Ignorance
*because I don't understand the counter-claim, my claim is true.*

Example: there's no way that monkeys can turn into humans, so evolution is clearly wrong.

This fallacy holds that something is true until it has been proven false— or something is false until it has been proven true. Both assertions do not follow logically. Ignorance, or lack of knowledge doesn't given any indication as to the truth or falsehood of the statement, logically.

Apply these ideas to the lack of archaeological evidence for the Book of Mormon denizens. The idea that “since there isn’t evidence, the church is false” is a fallacy. In this case, it’s absence of evidence, not evidence of absence.

The problem here is that there are an infinite number of things that haven't been proven true or false.

So if one believes that Mormonism is aided by lack of evidence to the contrary, one is then saddled with the burden of explaining why one particular thing is true with no evidence and another contradictory assertion is false without evidence.

### Argument from the Null Hypothesis

Because an event or data point is significantly divergent from a known statistical average, that event or data point can only be explained by outside forces and not random chance.  

Example: a traveling salesmen never fails to pray daily for safety, and never fails to catch any of the hundreds of flights he takes every year. On the one morning he accidentally sleeps in, the flight he was supposed to be on crashes. This proves that his prayers were heard and answered.
### Appeal to Consequences

_But if there is no God then there is no meaning or purpose to existence!_

The desirability or undesirability of the consequences of a claim are not evidence for or against the claim. This is closely related to Confirmation Bias, but easier to identify.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences)

### Appeal to Pity
Attempting to sway the audience by using emotional tactics to gain sympathy. 

Ex: “Since Mormons have been persecuted throughout the years, this faith must be true or otherwise these people wouldn’t have been attacked.”

It is true that some Mormons have been persecuted over the past two centuries. However, even if it’s true that Mormons have been unduly persecuted, this does not validate Mormonism’s truth claims. If so, would the Mormon consider biblical Christianity to be true merely because Christians around the world are persecuted on a daily basis for _their_ faith?

### Appeal to Popularity
Insisting that your position is true because other people agree with it. 

*“The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has millions of members. Do you really think that many people can be wrong?”*

_Most people believe in God, are they really all wrong?_

Just because a lot of people share the same view does not guarantee that the view they share is correct.

This one is kinda silly but I still see it all the time. You can always turn it around by pointing out that most people on earth don't believe in their religion (there is no religion with more than 50% of the world’s population)

By this metric, Catholicism would be a lot more "true" than Mormonism.

### Appeal to Possibility

_But its not impossible!_

This is surprisingly common. Pretty much anything is possible, we _could_ all be in the Matrix. But possibility is not sufficient to justify belief.

In the context of Mormonism, we'd then need to concede that all those lies about Joseph Smith are also possible. If one were to say that there's no way he destroyed the printing press for the Expositor, or used the Nauvoo Safety Society to defraud followers, this logical fallacy must also apply to that. It's not impossible that he did those things. In fact, there's documentation to support that he did those things.

### Bandwagon
Believing a view is correct because of its popularity. 
*“Since Mormonism is one of the fastest growing religions, there must be some truth to it.”*

Even if it were true that Mormonism is “one of the fastest growing religions,” this does not necessarily mean it’s true. Spiritual truth is not determined by popularity or growth in numbers.

Closely related to Appeal to Popularity.

### Burden of Proof

_But can you prove that Joseph Smith wasn’t a true prophet?_

Nearly every discussion will invoke this fallacy. You don’t have to show the church is false. Its their job to demonstrate that the church is true and they will always do everything they can to shift that burden to you so that they can rest upon the logical inability to prove a negative.

### Circular Reasoning

_God exists because the Bible says so, and God wrote the Bible so it must be true_
(Note: I'm not sure I've really heard anyone claim that God wrote the Bible. This is an oversimplistic example.)

When the argument being made relies upon the argument being true. This can be difficult to identify sometimes because its not always obvious, but always focus on what assumptions an argument is making, and sometimes you’ll find the conclusion hiding there.

Made up example:
> _"When I pray to know the BoM is true, then the spirit will gives me a good feeling which confirms to me the book is true."_

How do you know what you are feeling is a 'spirit' of God making you feel that way, and not just a conditioned feeling, or meditative peace, or any number of other sources that give you the nice feeling?

> _"Because the book of mormon tells me that this feeling comes from the Spirit."_

But how do you know the book of mormon is telling you the truth?

> _"Because I prayed and I felt the spirit, so I know it is true!"_

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning)

### False Dilemma
**Also called False Dichotomy**

Claiming that “either” proposition A or B is true when a third option is possible. 

*“If the Mormon Church isn’t true, then nothing is.”*

_If you’re wrong about God then you’re going to suffer in hell._

For the above example, this is the fallacy invoked by [Pascal’s Wager](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager).

Also commonly used in tandem with the God of the Gaps where God is invoked as a default explanation if science has no answer or a scientific theory is disproved by new observations

Different example:

> We must make a simple choice with the Book of Mormon: it is either of God or the devil. There is no other option.

[Tad R Callister, 2011](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)

How confident are we in the conclusion that “there is no other option”?

[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/False_dilemma](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/False_dilemma)

#### Disjunction with contraries
Ooh, the False Dilemma even has subtopics!

A contrary means that either A or B is true, but not both.
A contradictory means if A is true, then B is false.
Both are an example of XOR logic gate (exclusive "or")

A politician could say "either vote for me, or lose the dream of a great America!"
A pet food manufacturer could say "you can either buy *our* dog food, or your dog will be sad forever."

### Faulty Appeal to Authority
Basing an argument on the opinion of a person or group. 

*“I know for a fact that the Bible cannot be trusted. My bishop is a doctor and he said so.”*

This person’s bishop may be knowledgeable in his particular field of expertise, but it does not necessarily mean he is an expert when it comes to the accuracy of the Bible.

Other example would be trusting one's preferred politician to know about microbiology. Or, trusting a cardiac surgeon to know how to handle virology. Good thing neither of those things have ever happened! 🫢

### Genetic fallacy
Rejecting an idea based on its origin rather than on its merit. 

*“I found this video critical of Mormonism on a website that is not sponsored by the church, so its claims must be wrong.”*

Rather than disparaging the source of the information, the argument itself should be the focal point of the disagreement. Someone you don't like can be correct.

### God of the Gaps

_So what caused the Big Bang then? How else do you explain [something that isn’t fully understood]?_

Humans have a long and well documented history of invoking deities and other universal explanations (magic etc) to fill the gaps of our knowledge.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance)
### No true Scottsman

_Yeah but she (exmo) never had a testimony to begin with_

Nearly always used to dismiss experiences from former members. Very common among many faiths. If the claim is only made _after_ a member leaves its a form of ad hoc rationalization and confirmation bias.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)

### Personal incredulity
Because something is difficult to understand, it must be untrue. 

*“The doctrine of the Trinity is complicated and can’t be comprehended. This proves it can’t be true.”*

Trying to harmonize all the verses in the Bible that speak about God certainly involves in-depth study. But just because an explanation of something is not always simple does not make the premise false. There are many mysteries in Mormonism that also can’t be understood, including determining the reality of an infinite regression of the gods (determining just who the first God is).

### Red herring
Diverting the topic at hand by introducing another topic. 

*After having a Christian share about salvation by grace through faith outside the grounds of Temple Square, a Mormon responds, “Do you share your faith at Muslim mosques or Buddhist temples? If not, why don’t you go to those places instead of targeting Latter-day Saints?”*

Getting off-topic is a diversionary tactic meant to sideline the conversation. An appropriate reply might be: “I’d be more than happy to talk about that issue, but could we first finish our conversation on salvation by grace through faith?”

### Sharpshooter fallacy

Focusing on all the "hits" and ignoring all the "misses".

>The name comes from a metaphor about a person from Texas who fires a gun at the side of a barn, then paints a shooting target centered on the tightest cluster of shots and claims to be a sharpshooter.
— [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy)
 
>The Texas Sharpshooter fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs when data is selectively collected and then used to support the conclusion of the argument. It is commonly used to describe situations where a person or group of people cherry-pick data points from a set of available data to support a predetermined conclusion, giving the impression that the data points were chosen for their relevance to the conclusion. In other words, the data points are chosen not for their relevance to the conclusion, but for their ability to support the conclusion.
[Source](https://www.logicalfallacies.org/texas-sharpshooter.html)

- President Nelson predicted the Covid pandemic by saying that 2020’s general conference would be unlike others. Or his post to 'take your vitamins'.
- Joseph Smith predicted the civil war! (Ignoring his predictions of the end of the world or 2nd coming of Christ, or other vague prophecies)

### Special Pleading

Having standards that apply to others, but not oneself, without applying justification for the exemption. 

“Yes, Doctrine and Covenants 1:31 does say the Lord will not look upon sin with the least degree of allowance, but Heavenly Father loves me, so I’m sure I will be eligible for exaltation.”

Even though LDS scripture insists that no sin will be acceptable to God, those using this argument feel that they are somehow exempt from any penalty for their sin.

This can happen between sects of Christianity, trying to make a case for their congregation. Every faith adherent has spiritual experiences, they will nearly always invoke a special pleading fallacy to try and claim theirs is special and different.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading)
### Strawman Fallacy
Making a particular position look weak by misrepresenting the argument. 

_The Big Bang claims the universe came from nothing_

*According to History of the Church 6:476, Joseph Smith said the following: “Many men say there is one God; the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are only one God! I say that is a strange God anyhow—three in one, and one in three! It is a curious organization. . . . All are to be crammed into one God, according to sectarianism. It would make the biggest God in all the world. He would be a wonderfully big God—he would be a giant or a monster.”*

Smith gives an inaccurate analysis of what the Trinity teaches, making it easy to dismiss a God as described here. This version is certainly not an argument anyone would want to believe or defend.

We have all experienced a misrepresentation of what we said or believe, and it’s important to call out this fallacy. This is probably the most common fallacy of all time.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)

### Tu quoque
Latin for "you too."
Can also be called "two wrongs don't make a right" fallacy.

An attempt to ignore a criticism by pointing out an inconsistency or hypocrisy on the part of the critic. 

*“Yes, it is true that several of our past leaders made remarks that certainly sound racist. But have you never exhibited behavior that might make you appear to be prejudiced or bigoted? Besides, many people during that time period had similar views.”*

Instead of explaining the racist comments made by past LDS leaders, it avoids the criticism by pointing out the possible hypocrisy of the person asking the question.

## Rationalist Principles to understand

### Motivated Reasoning vs Critical Reasoning

The most important rationalist principle in my opinion, and the root cause of most of these fallacies is reasoning backwards from a favored or predetermined conclusion. We all do this because we have strong preferences for truth outcomes and we let those bias us. The wikipedia article is excellent:

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning)

### Evidence
If something is claimed as evidence in favor, then the inverse must be evidence against. E.g. if someone claims their deity helped them find their keys and this is evidence in favor, ask them if they hadnt found their keys, would they have counted that as evidence against God’s existence? This is how you spot confirmation bias.  

#### Sagan Standard
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_standard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_standard)
#### Hitchen's Razor
That which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence


[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor)
  

#### Pathos, Logos, Ethos

**Pathos** is appealing to the audience’s emotions when trying to argue. (e.g. Moroni’s promise). Having an emotional response to something is not evidence that it is true.

**Logos** is appealing to logic, which is what I am attempting to do with this note.

**Ethos** is an appeal to authority, which isn’t necessarily bad or wrong. If you don’t have a sufficient knowledge base to understand a logos argument, the best you can do is appeal to the consensus of the experts, but a logos argument is preferred. In general the strength of your opinion ought to be proportional to the depth of your knowledge on the subject.

## Bonus fallacy

**Moroni's Fallacy** - Failure to confirm the truth of an impossible counter-claim means that the claim is true.

Example: "Ask God if the things in this record _are not_ true. If ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.... And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is."

Moroni/JS asks the reader to ask God if the record is _not true_... and if it is true, God will confirm it."

The claim is thus "this historical record is true and God confirmed it." The counter-claim is "I asked God if it's _not true_ and God responded with 'yeah, bro! This shit is bogus.'" However, this is an impossible counter-claim because of Moroni's/JS's conditions:

- You must ask with a sincere heart, with real intent (this is a subjective condition; who determines what is sincere with real intent?)
- all good things are true.
- All good things _acknowledgeth_ the Christ.
- This record _acknowledgeth_ the Christ, therefore it is good.
- Because this record is good, it is therefore true.
- Thus, God cannot whisper _anything_ to you other than "it's true."

&nbsp;

**A non-Mormon example of Moroni's Fallacy:** "just ask yourself the question, is it _impossible_ for aliens to have been involved in the construction of the pyramids? How do you know aliens were _not_ involved? I'm not saying they used spaceships to lift rocks or anything like that; they might have used advanced tech to inspire the Egyptians to build them. Who knows? Good science means following the evidence to any conclusion, no matter how improbable. Given time, and given how many open questions remain about the pyramids, Egyptologists will have no choice but to consider this possibility."
