# Emotional Thinking
## Testimony
A noteworthy video, of people from a wide variety of religious inclinations testifying of their spiritual witness:

Here are a few transcribed excerpts:

### **Orthodox Judaism**
> _"I started to have a very strong feeling of missing something and seeking something... it really had such a profound impact on me and I started reading about Judaism... I have a very short answer to people who ask me 'why on earth would you want to convert to Orthodox Judaism?' Because God told me to."_

&nbsp;

### **Catholicism**
> _"A friend of mine who was praying for me at that moment, sensed Mother Mary came to me, took pity on me, and asked her son to save me. And I knew after that, that the cancer was gone, that I should sin no more, and shortly after that I knew I was called to join the Catholic church - a church I had never stepped foot in."_

  &nbsp;

### **The People's Temple (Jim Jones)**
> _"We were doing a meditation - myself and five other friends - and all of the sudden I felt this explosion of energy go up my spine from behind. Bang. And I turned around and saw this picture and I said 'who is that?' Oh that's Papa Jim - he's the most loving man... and I knew I had to find Jim Jones and the People's Temple."_

  &nbsp;

### **The True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days (current LDS polygamist offshoot)**

> _”I’ve been searching for a witness of this work and of this church and just tonight I got my witness and it’s burning within my soul how important this work is and how true it is. I know it is. And it’s hard to believe that just a year ago I was in high school and now I am in a plural marriage and struggling. But I know without a shadow of a doubt, that this is the Lord’s work. That I’ve finally found it. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.”_

&nbsp;

Not sure what commentary to add.

If simply testifying with emotion makes something true, then we’re in trouble. All of these faiths can’t concurrently be true, can they?
