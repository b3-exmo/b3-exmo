# 🥺 Emotional Thinking
> **Emotional reasoning** is a [cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive "Cognitive") process by which an individual concludes that their [emotional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion "Emotion") reaction proves something is true, despite contrary [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence").

— *[Emotional reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_reasoning)*, Wikipedia

&nbsp;

I remember being a teenager and hearing the argument that "the fact that humans cry is proof that God exists". The rationale was that our spirits are experiencing an emotion so intensely, be it positive or negative, that our physical bodies can't handle it, but we're still feeling it, so we cry. Therefore, we have spirits, therefore we're children of God, therefore God exists, Joseph was a prophet, and it's all [[True|true]].

There are a [[logical-fallacies|few problems]] with this perspective— among them, the idea that [[Falsifiability|I can't prove it happened]], but the logical leaps and jumps to arrive at the conclusion this Young Men's leader already had in mind are, in retrospect, baffling.

Humans connect with emotional experiences. Marriage ceremonies are, by my understanding, an emotional commitment and have no objective value whatsoever. Does that mean they're bad? Useless? Waste of ~~money~~ time? Not necessarily. I look back on my wedding day with fondness, and I love my wife. One could argue that this emotional attachment to the event is more valuable than the money spent on the venue, catering, etc. I don't want to come off as the snarky contrarian who thinks human emotions are holding us back. Emotions— positive or negative— are what make us human. I bet a philosophy student would have some words for me, but that's where I stand today.

&nbsp;

## In Religion
I don't want to come off as a contrarian, pompous, "better than you plebes 'cause I criticize religions on *the internet* 😤" kind of guy. Religions hold value. It's easy to point to [egregious things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) done in the name of religion, but it's harder to quantify how millions of lay folk find comfort in it. I can attest that it quells existential dread. I'm not qualified to try and assess if Christianity is a net positive or net negative; the [Spanish Inquisition torturing people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition#Torture) to prove heresy tips the scales toward negative. All done in the name of Jesus.

With that out of the way, consider what religious practices do with emotionally vulnerable people. My own experience is with the LDS church, so if your upbringing differs, I'm interested to know how much overlap there is here:

* God is our *father*
* Jesus is our *brother* (so is Satan, cough cough)
* Pray to God when you're sad, lonely, despondent, etc
* Pray to express gratitude
* Find solace in scripture study
* Confess sins to alleviate guilt, find absolution
* Church leaders are given endearing titles ("our beloved prophet", [current prophet name])
* Read about the church's [[Tithing#Charitable efforts|charitable givings]] (but don't look too hard pls); we're saving poor kids in Africa, just like Jesus would!
* A family member passed away? Better [take advantage of your emotional state](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1988/10/funerals-a-time-for-reverence?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) to preach about how [*you* can qualify for exaltation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1988/10/funerals-a-time-for-reverence?lang=eng&id=p31-p32#p31) in the afterlife!
* Lost your job? Sounds like an opportunity for missionaries to come preach to you, while you're feeling uncertain about your immediate future!

Emotions are part of the human experience, and folks develop an emotional relationship with aspects of their religion. Sometimes that feels predatory. Inspiring emotions can really influence people to become fiercely loyal to the organization.

## Testimony
Shoutout to [ldsdiscussions.com](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/testimonies) for putting together these insights. This page has a much more verbose explanation of the following notes, including this noteworthy video of people from a wide variety of religious inclinations testifying of their spiritual witness:

[![Recordings of various religious experiences](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UJMSU8Qj6Go/3.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go)

Here are a few transcribed excerpts:

### Orthodox Judaism
> *"I started to have a very strong feeling of missing something and seeking something... it really had such a profound impact on me and I started reading about Judaism... I have a very short answer to people who ask me 'why on earth would you want to convert to Orthodox Judaism?' Because God told me to."*

&nbsp;

### Catholicism
> *"A friend of mine who was praying for me at that moment, sensed Mother Mary came to me, took pity on me, and asked her son to save me. And I knew after that, that the cancer was gone, that I should sin no more, and shortly after that I knew I was called to join the Catholic church - a church I had never stepped foot in."*

&nbsp;

### The People's Temple (Jim Jones)
> *"We were doing a meditation - myself and five other friends - and all of the sudden I felt this explosion of energy go up my spine from behind. Bang. And I turned around and saw this picture and I said 'who is that?' Oh that's Papa Jim - he's the most loving man... and I knew I had to find Jim Jones and the People's Temple."*

&nbsp;

### The True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days (current LDS polygamist offshoot)

> *”I’ve been searching for a witness of this work and of this church and just tonight I got my witness and it’s burning within my soul how important this work is and how true it is. I know it is. And it’s hard to believe that just a year ago I was in high school and now I am in a plural marriage and struggling. But I know without a shadow of a doubt, that this is the Lord’s work. That I’ve finally found it. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.”*

&nbsp;

Not sure what commentary to add.

If simply testifying with emotion makes something true, then we’re in trouble. All of these faiths can’t concurrently be true, can they?

&nbsp;  

## Elevation Emotion
I don't know that I should call this uniquely human, but I can emphasize that this is an *emotion*.

> *Elevation is an emotion elicited by witnessing ==actual or imagined== virtuous acts of remarkable moral goodness. It is experienced as a distinct feeling of warmth and expansion that is accompanied by appreciation and affection for the individual whose exceptional conduct is being observed. Elevation motivates those who experience it to open up to, affiliate with, and assist others. Elevation makes an individual feel lifted up and optimistic about humanity.*

— *[Elevation_(emotion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation_(emotion))*, Wikipedia

&nbsp;

> **What does science tell us about elevation?**
> 
> A recent review of the literature on elevation (Thomson & Siegel 2017), looks at the research evidence. They suggest experiencing elevation:
> 
> - Is associated with physiological responses such as increased heart rate, the release of oxytocin and simultaneous activation of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
> - Promotes feelings of connection with, and optimism about, humanity.
> - Increases desire to be a better person and to pursue eudaimonic motives.
> - Encourages a sense of transcendence and spirituality, diminishing the value of material goals.
> - Increases openness in common with other positive emotions, as described in Fredrickson’s (1998) Broaden and Build theory.
> - Increases actual helping behaviour at an individual level.
> - Can promote more inclusive attitudes at a group level.
> - Can have a positive impact even in those who are depressed.
> 
> So, elevation gives you an injection of the feel-good cuddle hormone, helps you be more open, feel connected to others and hopeful about humanity, care less about stuff and more about meaning, reduces bias (racism, homophobia) and makes you more likely to help people.

&nbsp;

> *I believe we cannot have a full under­standing of human morality until we can explain why and how human beings are so powerfully affected by the sight of a stranger helping another stranger. For the past several years I have studied this feeling, which I call “elevation.” I have deﬁned elevation as a warm, uplifting feeling that people experience when they see unexpected acts of human good­ness, kindness, courage, or compassion. It makes a person want to help others and to become a better person himself or herself.*

&nbsp;

To be clear, I'm not trying to shit on people for having positive emotions. If practicing LDS teachings inspires this emotion within you, by all means, keep going. I do want you, reader, to realize that the Brighamite LDS church does not have a monopoly on warm-fuzzy feel-goods.

The article quoted above, from Greater Good Magazine, isn't some theological authority, but *that's the point* of bringing it up in this context. I highly recommend reading it in its entirety. It is not meant to tear down your faith or beliefs. It describes what Mormonism calls *the Spirit™* in non-religious terms.

&nbsp;

### The Spirit™
> *But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and ==if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right==.*

— [D&C 9:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)

&nbsp;

> ***Recognizing the Holy Spirit***
> 
> *God communicates with us through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can come to us in the form of good thoughts and ideas or as peaceful, comforting feelings. ==When we have good thoughts or feelings, it means that God is encouraging us, showing us truth, and giving us direction==.*
> 
> “Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?”
> 
> [Luke 24:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/24?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)
> 
> *We all feel the Holy Spirit in our own way. Sometimes it’s described in the Bible as a “still small voice” ([1 Kings 19:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)) that almost seems to whisper to your mind.*

— *[The Holy Spirit](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/uk/beliefs/coming-closer-to-god/holy-spirit)*, Come unto Christ, churchofjesuschrist.org (UK)

&nbsp;

> *Pray to Heavenly Father to bless you with His Spirit at all times. We often call the Spirit the Holy Ghost. … The Holy Ghost helps you to choose the right. The Holy Ghost will protect you from evil. He whispers to you in a still, small voice to do right. ==When you do good, you feel good, and that is the Holy Ghost speaking to you==. The Holy Ghost is a wonderful companion. He is always there to help you.*

. . .

> *We hear the words of the Lord most often by a feeling. If we are humble and sensitive, the Lord will prompt us through our feelings. That is ==why spiritual promptings move us on occasion to great joy, sometimes to tears==. Many times my emotions have been made tender and my feelings very sensitive when touched by the Spirit.*
> 
> *The Holy Ghost causes our feelings to be more tender. We feel more charitable and compassionate with each other. We are ==more calm== in our relationships. We have a ==greater capacity to love== each other. People want to be around us because our very countenances radiate the influence of the Spirit. We are more godly in our character. As a result, we become increasingly more sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and thus able to comprehend spiritual things more clearly.*

&nbsp;

> *On October 9, 1959, between sessions of general conference in Salt Lake City, Howard learned that President David O. McKay wanted to meet with him. He immediately went to the Church Administration Building, where President McKay greeted him warmly and said, “President Hunter, … the Lord has spoken. You are called to be one of his special witnesses, and tomorrow you will be sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve.” Regarding that experience, Howard wrote:*
> 
> *“I cannot attempt to explain the feeling that came over me. ==Tears came to my eyes and I could not speak==. I have never felt so completely humbled as when I sat in the presence of this great, sweet, kindly man—the prophet of the Lord. He told me what a great joy this would bring into my life, the wonderful association with the brethren, and that hereafter my life and time would be devoted as a servant of the Lord and that I would hereafter belong to the Church and the whole world. … He put his arms around me and assured me that the Lord would love me and I would have the sustaining confidence of the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve. … I [told him] I would gladly give my time, my life, and all that I possessed to this service.”*
> 
> *As soon as Howard left President McKay’s office, he went to his hotel room and called Claire, who was in Provo visiting their son John and his wife and their baby. At first Howard could hardly speak. When he finally told Claire of the calling, they were both overcome with emotion.*
