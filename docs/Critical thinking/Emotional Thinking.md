# 🥺 Emotional Thinking
I remember being a teenager and hearing the argument that "the fact that humans cry is proof that God exists". The rationale was that our spirits are experiencing an emotion so intensely, be it positive or negative, that our physical bodies can't handle it, but we're still feeling it, so we cry. Therefore, we have spirits, therefore we're children of God, therefore God exists, Joseph was a prophet, and it's all [[True|true]].

There are a [[Logical Fallacies|few problems]] with this perspective— among them, the idea that [[Falsifiability|I can't prove it happened]], but the logical leaps and jumps to arrive at the conclusion this Young Men's leader already had in mind are, in retrospect, baffling.

Humans connect with emotional experiences. Marriage ceremonies are, by my understanding, an emotional commitment and have no objective value whatsoever. Does that mean they're bad? Useless? Waste of ~~money~~ time? Not necessarily. I look back on my wedding day with fondness, and I love my wife. One could argue that this emotional attachment to the event is more valuable than the money spent on the venue, catering, etc. I don't want to come off as the snarky contrarian who thinks human emotions are holding us back. Emotions— positive or negative— are what make us human. I bet a philosophy student would have some words for me, but that's where I stand today.

## In Religion
I know I've mentioned this elsewhere, but I don't want to come off as contrarian, pompous, "better than you plebes 'cause I criticize religions on *the internet* 😤" kind of guy. Religions hold value. It's easy to point to [egregious things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) done in the name of religion, but it's harder to quantify how millions of lay folk find comfort in it. I can attest that it quells existential dread. I'm not qualified to try and assess if Christianity is a net positive or net negative; the [Spanish Inquisition torturing people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition#Torture) to prove heresy tips the scales toward negative. All done in the name of Jesus.

With that out of the way, consider what religious practices do with emotionally vulnerable people. My own experience is with the LDS church, so if your upbringing differs, I'm interested to know how much overlap there is here:

* God is our *father*
* Jesus is our *brother* (so is Satan, cough cough)
* Pray to God when you're sad, lonely, despondent, etc
* Pray to express gratitude
* Find solace in scripture study
* Confess sins to alleviate guilt, find absolution
* Church leaders are given endearing titles ("our beloved prophet", [current prophet name])
* Read about the church's [[Tithing#Charitable efforts|charitable givings]] (but don't look too hard pls); we're saving poor kids in Africa, just like Jesus would!
* A family member passed away? Better [take advantage of your emotional state](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1988/10/funerals-a-time-for-reverence?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) to preach about how [*you* can qualify for exaltation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1988/10/funerals-a-time-for-reverence?lang=eng&id=p31-p32#p31) in the afterlife!
* Lost your job? Sounds like an opportunity for missionaries to come preach to you, while you're feeling uncertain about your immediate future!

Emotions are part of the human experience, and folks develop an emotional relationship with aspects of their religion. Sometimes that feels predatory. Inspiring emotions can really influence people to become fiercely loyal to the organization.

## Testimony
A noteworthy video, of people from a wide variety of religious inclinations testifying of their spiritual witness:

[![Recordings of various religious experiences](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UJMSU8Qj6Go/3.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go)

Here are a few transcribed excerpts:

### Orthodox Judaism
> *"I started to have a very strong feeling of missing something and seeking something... it really had such a profound impact on me and I started reading about Judaism... I have a very short answer to people who ask me 'why on earth would you want to convert to Orthodox Judaism?' Because God told me to."*

&nbsp;

### Catholicism
> *"A friend of mine who was praying for me at that moment, sensed Mother Mary came to me, took pity on me, and asked her son to save me. And I knew after that, that the cancer was gone, that I should sin no more, and shortly after that I knew I was called to join the Catholic church - a church I had never stepped foot in."*

&nbsp;

### The People's Temple (Jim Jones)
> *"We were doing a meditation - myself and five other friends - and all of the sudden I felt this explosion of energy go up my spine from behind. Bang. And I turned around and saw this picture and I said 'who is that?' Oh that's Papa Jim - he's the most loving man... and I knew I had to find Jim Jones and the People's Temple."*

&nbsp;

### The True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days (current LDS polygamist offshoot)

> *”I’ve been searching for a witness of this work and of this church and just tonight I got my witness and it’s burning within my soul how important this work is and how true it is. I know it is. And it’s hard to believe that just a year ago I was in high school and now I am in a plural marriage and struggling. But I know without a shadow of a doubt, that this is the Lord’s work. That I’ve finally found it. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.”*

&nbsp;

Not sure what commentary to add.

If simply testifying with emotion makes something true, then we’re in trouble. All of these faiths can’t concurrently be true, can they?
