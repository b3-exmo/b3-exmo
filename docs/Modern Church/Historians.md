## History
> *My view is that being open about our history solves a whole lot more problems than it creates. We might not have all the answers, but if we are open (and we now have pretty remarkable transparency), then I think in the long run that will serve us well. I think ==in the past there was a tendency to keep a lot of the records closed or at least not give access to information==. But the world has changed in the last generationâ€”with the access to information on the Internet, ==we canâ€™t continue that pattern==; I think we need to continue to be more open.*

â€” Steven E Snow; [Start with Faith: A Conversation with Elder Steven E. Snow](https://rsc.byu.edu/vol-14-no-3-2013/start-faith-conversation-elder-steven-e-snow), BYU Religious Studies Center

This interview took place in 2013, while Elder Snow was the official church historian. His remarks do raise a question in my mind, though- what is this "pattern" that we can't continue?

That is rhetorical, of course- he says right there that the unsustainable practice is to "keep records closed" or "not give access to information." Tell me I'm wrong.

The office of Historian has some [unusual background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Historian_and_Recorder) in itself! There is what I would call a suspicious pattern of God calling only lawyers to fill the space. You know, folks whose livelihood and profession revolves around their ability to spin truth, argue and defend the indefensible? Seem odd to anyone else? The Lord works in mysterious ways, I suppose. Wouldn't we want a historian to serve in this capacity?

- [Dean L Larsen](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1976/11/news-of-the-church/elder-dean-l-larsen-of-the-first-quorum-of-seventy?lang=eng) was Church Historian from [1985 to 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_L._Larsen)
	- Elder Snow states "I really donâ€™t know why the office went unfilled for a few yearsâ€”actually since Elder Dean L. Larsen was released in 1997."
- [Marlin K Jensen](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/leader/marlin-k-jensen?lang=eng) was next, from [2005 to 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlin_K._Jensen), What I find most interesting about this development is Jensen's background in law practice.
	- "Elder Jensen ==previously practiced law== in Ogden, Utah, specializing in business and estate planning. . . . and his Juris Doctor degree from the ==University of Utah Law School== in Salt Lake City, Utah."
- [Steven E Snow](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/leader/steven-e-snow?lang=eng) was the historian from [2012 to 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_E._Snow). And, wouldn't you know it, he's also a lawyer.
	- "Prior to his call to serve as a full-time General Authority of the Church, Elder Snow was a senior partner in the ==Utah law firm== of Snow Nuffer."
	- "The St. George, Utah, native attended Dixie College and earned his bachelorâ€™s degree in accounting at Utah State University and his ==law degree== at Brigham Young University."
- [LeGrand R Curtis Jr.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/legrand-r-curtis-jr?lang=eng) was the historian from 2019 to 2022
	- "His career includes ==work as an attorney== and partner in the law firm Manning Curtis Bradshaw & Bednar and as an adjunct professor at the J. Reuben Clark Law School at Brigham Young University."
- [Kyle S. McKay](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/kyle-s-mckay?lang=eng) is, at the time of writing, the acting church historian.
	- "In 1987 he received a ==juris doctor degree== from Brigham Young University. From 1987 to 2018 Elder McKay ==practiced law== in Oregon and Utah."

Well golly gee, it's almost as if the church office building *really* values their historian's ability to argue and defend against accusations. One day I may look into these men's careers to determine if they were defense attorneys or prosecutors, but... today, I don't have that information.
