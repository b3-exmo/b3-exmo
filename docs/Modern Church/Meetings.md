## Sacrament
Mormon doctrine is a mile wide but only an inch deep. You never actually learn anything. You never actually find answers.

All the miracle stories are just regular human events that are repackaged and retold in such a way to make them seem supernatural.

The hymns contain words about visions of angels, gods, battles, and heavens that we never actually experience.

The language of prayer is trite, hackneyed, and repetitive.

The voting is not a vote. It’s a public signal. The sacrament is not a sacrament. It’s a public signal.

Even vintage Mormon doctrine has been replaced with neo-covenant path Mormonism. 

The religion feels dead. The worst part is that the burden of proof has been shifted to the members so we’re made to feel bad if we’re not entertained or spiritually enlightened.
