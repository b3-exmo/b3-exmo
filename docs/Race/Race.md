# 🏁 Race
For 126 years, between [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]’s presidency beginning and 1978, imagine thousands of black Mormons praying to God to please lift the temple/priesthood ban… Then imagine David O’McKay praying and concluding, “Nah. We’re good for now.”

A church that claims to be [[Restoration|restored]] by God should be ahead of the ‘[[Book of Mormon#Natural Man|natural man]]’ in getting things right, not behind. They took away the right of black members to enter the Celestial Kingdom, which is a spiritual issue, not a civil issue. We can call it a priesthood ban, but let's not overlook that priesthood is a prerequisite for salvation.

The LDS church has had some really odd takes on race in the past, and today likes to pretend that none of it ever happened. I'll be aggregating some quotes, teachings, and adding my own comments and thoughts to them. I will note that I am a white American, arguably the least qualified demographic to offer meaningful commentary on racial prejudice as none of this has ever [impacted me directly](https://youtu.be/RovF1zsDoeM&t=54). Also, please note that I'll be using direct quotes from LDS church figureheads in the 19th century who use terms that we today consider to be offensive slurs.

### [Gospel Topics Essay](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood) notes
> *Latter-day Saint scripture and teachings affirm that God loves all of His children and makes salvation available to all. God created the many diverse races and ethnicities and esteems them all equally. As the Book of Mormon puts it, “[all are alike unto God.](ptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p33#p33)”*

Well... If we attribute scripture to divine revelation from God, I think [[Race in scripture|I could make an argument]] that perhaps *not* all are alike unto God. At least, not the God of the LDS church, as these problematic scriptures are exclusive to the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price. Moreover, if we're to believe that prophets speak in God's behalf such that [their voices are functionally indistinguishable](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1?lang=eng&id=p38#p38), and when the prophet say and do some offensively racist things, that makes me think that the God of the LDS church esteems one race over another. Either that, or this given prophet was not called of God. Either way, we have a problem.

&nbsp;

> . . . *[F]or much of its history—from the mid-1800s until 1978—the Church did not ordain men of black African descent to its priesthood or allow black men or women to participate in temple endowment or sealing ordinances.*

🤨 Didn't we just establish that "all are alike unto God?" Why would God's official restored church exclude a specific race for 126 years? Does God's official restored church not represent His will?

I'd also like to point out this explicit acknowledgement that simply disallowing black men from holding priesthood authority cascades into other matters&mdash; if  interracial marriage is also forbidden, that means anyone of African ancestry is simply not allowed to participate in saving ordinances. They can't be endowed nor sealed. Their families will not be [together forever](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/songs/families-can-be-together-forever-1989?lang=eng), explicitly because of Heavenly Father's plan. But don't worry too much, all are alike unto God. ... Maybe.

Let's not overlook the nebulous "mid-1800s" timeframe. We can trace [down to the day](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/record/5df3b7da-d0a5-437b-8268-7dde8a87c76e/e6a939a0-3402-4771-814d-4eaf2547e613) when this doctrine was established by the prophet of God, to lead His one, true church. It was Thursday, 5 February 1852, and [finally reversed](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2?lang=eng) on Thursday, 1 June 1978. We're looking at 126 years, 3 months, and 27 days. 46,137 days of God, eternal and unchanging, being completely oblivious or complacent before ultimately revealing that "actually, black folks are allowed to be saved now." Just a prank, bro.

&nbsp;

> *From the beginnings of the Church, people of every race and ethnicity could be baptized and received as members. Toward the end of his life, Church founder Joseph Smith openly opposed slavery. There has never been a Churchwide policy of segregated congregations.*

We'll take a win when we can find one, I guess— "We never turned someone away from baptim... *based on their race*."

"Toward the end of [Joseph's] life" seems to be a big qualifier. How did Smith feel about slavery for the other ~35 years before that nonspecific turning point?

"There's never been a *churchwide* policy on segregated congregations" sounds like a hefty qualifier as well. It's even got a [footnote](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng#note3) on that sentence:

>*At some periods of time, reflecting local customs and laws, there were instances of segregated congregations in areas such as South Africa and the U.S. South.*

It wasn't churchwide, though, so I guess we can just ignore the admittance of segregation in Mormon wards. 🙄

&nbsp;

> *During the first two decades of the Church’s existence, a few black men were ordained to the priesthood. One of these men, Elijah Abel, also participated in temple ceremonies [. . .] and was later baptized as proxy for deceased relatives in Nauvoo, Illinois. ==There is no reliable evidence== that any black men were denied the priesthood during Joseph Smith’s lifetime.*

So... is there *unreliable* evidence of that? For an organization with a vested interest in one angle of a narrative to acknowledge and exclude evidence makes me think that evidence is worth examining. It makes me think that the reader should be the one to determine reliability.

Asserting that there's "no reliable evidence" during Joseph Smith's presidency isn't quite the flex you seem to think it is. If we were to excuse him, we still have 11 other acting presidents of God's true, restored church to examine, not to mention their respective apostles and first presidencies, *all of whom* are called as prophets to bring God's will to us common folk. The easiest example to point to is [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]'s presidency, where we find some pretty unambiguous documentation on God's chosen vessel, representative, spokesman, being racist as *fuck*. Joseph's presidency has some conflicting information about racial dispositions&mdash; one day he’s for equality, others not so much. How should I feel about the idea that both men were called of God to be a prophet? I don't like the idea of pinning all of this on Joseph Smith. He's got [[Joseph Smith|his own set of issues]] to sort through, but this doctrine on race persisted for an uncomfortably long time.

&nbsp;

> *The justifications for this restriction echoed the widespread ideas about racial inferiority that had been used to argue for the legalization of black “servitude” in the Territory of Utah. According to one view, which had been promulgated in the United States from at least the 1730s, blacks descended from the same lineage as the biblical Cain, who slew his brother Abel. Those who accepted this view believed that God’s “curse” on Cain was the mark of a dark skin. Black servitude was sometimes viewed as a second curse placed upon Noah’s grandson Canaan as a result of Ham’s indiscretion toward his father. Although slavery was not a significant factor in Utah’s economy and was soon abolished, the restriction on priesthood ordinations remained.*

&nbsp;

Stop distancing your history from these offensive ideas. *Don't even try that shit*, Brigham Young is on record as [[Brigham Young#Get the priesthood in some future day|teaching this exact idea as LDS doctrine]]. Once again, if God's voice and His prophet's voice are the same, [[Brigham Young#Race|God is the one advocating for slavery in Utah]]. If it's going to be "soon abolished," why did God, eternal and unchanging, allow His representative to enact it in the first place? What was the turnaround time for that change? Any common ground with an LDS ~~policy~~ doctrine from 2015 that got reversed?

&nbsp;

> *As the Church grew worldwide, its overarching mission to “go ye therefore, and teach all nations” seemed increasingly incompatible with the priesthood and temple restrictions. The [Book of Mormon](http://www.comeuntochrist.org/beliefs/book-of-mormon) declared that the gospel message of salvation should go forth to “every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.” While there were no limits on whom the Lord invited to “partake of his goodness” through baptism, the priesthood and temple restrictions created significant barriers, a point made increasingly evident as the Church spread in international locations with diverse and mixed racial heritages.*
>
> *Brazil in particular presented many challenges. Unlike the United States and South Africa where legal and de facto racism led to deeply segregated societies, Brazil prided itself on its open, integrated, and mixed racial heritage. In 1975, the Church announced that a temple would be built in São Paulo, Brazil. As the temple construction proceeded, Church authorities encountered faithful black and mixed-ancestry Latter-day Saints who had contributed financially and in other ways to the building of the São Paulo temple, a sanctuary they realized they would not be allowed to enter once it was completed. Their sacrifices, as well as the conversions of thousands of Nigerians and Ghanaians in the 1960s and early 1970s, moved Church leaders.*

What? The entire world doesn't see race the way America does? ... And the prophet of God for the entire world didn't anticipate that?

This reminds me of the hand-waving I've encountered for treatment of LGBT folks&mdash; "we're not turning them away, they're welcome to attend sacrament meeting!" I mean, yeah, but they still can't participate in all of the requisite saving ordinances. To assert "we never prevented black folks from being baptized" is missing the point. They can't get into the temple, *even if they paid money to construct it*. What this sounds like to me is God wasn't involved in this decision to put a temple in São Paulo. Building a temple shouldn't result in a logistical problem for allowing demographics of members to even make use of it. Did God get blindsided by this discrepancy, too?

&nbsp;

> *Today, the Church disavows the ==theories== advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects unrighteous actions in a premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else. Church leaders today unequivocally condemn all racism, past and present, in any form.*

Yeah? That's what the church does? It "disavows theories advanced in the past?" [[Race in scripture#Book of Mormon|Scriptures contain]] incorrect theories? *Why are you calling doctrine theories?*

## Pre-1978
### 1949 First Presidency Statement
> *August 17, 1949*  
>   
> *The attitude of the Church with reference to Negroes remains as it has always stood. It is not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord, on which is founded the doctrine of the Church from the days of its organization, to the effect that Negroes may become members of the Church but that they are not entitled to the priesthood at the present time. The prophets of the Lord have made several statements as to the operation of the principle. President Brigham Young said: "Why are so many of the inhabitants of the earth cursed with a skin of blackness? It comes in consequence of their fathers rejecting the power of the holy priesthood, and the law of God. They will go down to death. And when all the rest of the children have received their blessings in the holy priesthood, then that curse will be removed from the seed of Cain, and they will then come up and possess the priesthood, and receive all the blessings which we now are entitled to."*  
>   
> *President Wilford Woodruff made the following statement: "The day will come when all that race will be redeemed and possess all the blessings which we now have."*  
>   
> *The position of the Church regarding the Negro may be understood when another doctrine of the Church is kept in mind, namely, that the conduct of spirits in the premortal existence has some determining effect upon the conditions and circumstances under which these spirits take on mortality and that while the details of this principle have not been made known, the mortality is a privilege that is given to those who maintain their first estate; and that the worth of the privilege is so great that spirits are willing to come to earth and take on bodies no matter what the handicap may be as to the kind of bodies they are to secure; and that among the handicaps, failure of the right to enjoy in mortality the blessings of the priesthood is a handicap which spirits are willing to assume in order that they might come to earth. Under this principle there is no injustice whatsoever involved in this deprivation as to the holding of the priesthood by the Negroes.*

### Mark E Petersen
This guy has numerous things to say about race. I'll put just one quote here, but I assure you that plenty more exist. I've got some additional excerpts [[Various Quotes#Mark E. Peterson|on another page]].

> *I would be willing that they have all the advantages they can get out of life in the world. but let them enjoy these things among themselves. I think the Lord segregated the Negro and who is man to change that segregation? It reminds me of the scripture on marriage, “what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” Only here we have the reverse of the thing—what God hath separated, let not man bring together again.*

Alright, sure, cool, you can disavow theories, but *[[Race in scripture|scripture]] is not theory.* Until you disavow that *doctrine*, your words mean shit to me.

### LeGrand Richards
> *5 weeks after the initial announcement, two men were granted an opportunity to speak with LeGrand Richards, one of the senior Apostles. They asked several key questions of the Elder and one of the most straightforward descriptions of the process of modern revelation was given in reply. In addition, other interesting topics were discussed including the existence of Joseph’s seer-stone, the legitimacy of the “Lectures on Faith” and changes to the Book of Mormon.*

&mdash; *[The Legrand Richards Interview](https://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/the-legrand-richards-interview)*, Thoughts on Things and Stuff

The link above has a transcription of this interview, along with links to [an audio recording](https://archive.org/details/1978LegrandRichardsInterview) and [an offsite transcript](https://archive.org/details/CorrespondenceWithLeGrandRichardsRegarding1978Interview). I'll include two excerpts of that interview here:

> **WALTERS**: *On this revelation, of the priesthood to the Negro, I’ve heard all kinds of stories: I’ve heard that Christ appeared to the Apostles. I’ve heard that Joseph Smith appeared; and then I heard another story that Spencer Kimball had had a concern about this for some time and simply shared it with the apostles, and they decided that this was the right time to move in that direction. Now are any of those stories true, or are they all…*
> 
> **RICHARDS**: *Well, the last one is pretty true, and ==I might tell you what provoked it== in a way. Down in Brazil, there is so much Negro blood in the population there that it’s hard to get leaders that don’t have Negro blood in them. ==We just built a temple down there. It’s going to be dedicated in October. All those people with Negro blood in them have been raising the money to build that temple. And then, if we don’t change, then they can’t even use it==. So Brother Kimball worried about it, and he prayed a lot about it.*
> 
> *He asked each one of us of the Twelve if we would pray – and we did – that the Lord would give him the inspiration to know what the will of the Lord was. And then he invited each one of us in his office – individually, because you know when you are in a group, you can’t always express everything that’s in your heart. You’re part of the group, you see – so he interviewed each one of us, personally, to see how we felt about it, and he asked us to pray about it. And then he asked each one of us to hand in all the references we had, for, or against that proposal. See, he was thinking favorably toward giving the colored people the priesthood.*
> 
> *Then we had a meeting where we meet every week in the temple, and we discussed it as a group together, and then we prayed about it in our prayer circle, and then we held another prayer circle after the close of that meeting, and he (President Kimball) lead in the prayer; praying that the Lord would give us the inspiration that we needed to do the thing that would be pleasing to Him and for the blessing of His children. And then the next Thursday – we meet every Thursday – the Presidency came with this little document written out to make the announcement – to see how we’d feel about it – and present it in written form. Well, some of the members of the Twelve suggested a few changes in the announcement, and then in our meeting there we all voted in favor of it – the Twelve and the Presidency. One member of the Twelve, Mark Petersen, was down in South America, but Brother Benson, our President, had arranged to know where he could be reached by phone, and right while we were in that meeting in the temple, Brother Kimball talked with Brother Petersen, and read him this article, and he (Petersen) approved of it.*

---

> **VLACHOS:** *What about intermarriage? Is it okay?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *what?*
> 
> **VLACHOS:** *Is it okay to marry?*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *Intermarriage, is that in view too?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *Well, no. Never before this decision was reached we’ve always recommended that people live within their own race – the Japanese ought to marry Japanese, the Chinese ought to marry Chinese, Hawaiians ought to marry Hawaiians and the colored people ought to marry colored.*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *And that would still be your position?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *That is still our position. But they are entitled to the temple blessings and the sealing of their wives to them. It’s all conditioned on their living. Now if they live right and they’re devoted and they’re good clean living – why shouldn’t they get the blessings?*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *Now when President Kimball read this little announcement or paper, was that the same thing that was released to the press?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *Yeah.*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *There wasn’t a special document as a “revelation”, that he had and wrote down?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *We discussed it in our meeting. What else should we say besides that announcement? And we decided that was sufficient; that no more needed to be said.*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *Was that the letter you sent out to the various wards?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *And to the Church; and to the newspapers, yes.*
> 
> **VLACHOS:** *Will that become a part of “scripture”?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *Yes, I’ve already thought in my own mind of suggesting we add it to the Pearl of Great Price, just like those last two revelations that we’ve just added.*

Sounds to me like this "revelation" is in response to a business problem. They built a temple, but locals wouldn't be able to use it after paying for its construction, and that was "what provoked it."

&nbsp;

## 2000 & Later
> *Unfortunately, racism—the abhorrent and morally destructive ==theory== that claims superiority of one person over another by reason of race, color, ethnicity, or cultural background—remains one of the abiding sins of societies the world over. The cause of much of the strife and conflict in the world, racism is an offense against God and a tool in the devil’s hands. In common with other Christians, ==members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regret the actions and statements of individuals who have been insensitive to the pain suffered by the victims of racism and ask God’s forgiveness for those guilty of this grievous sin==. The sin of racism will be eliminated only when every human being treats all others with the dignity and respect each deserves as a beloved child of our Heavenly Father.*
> 
> *How grateful I am that ==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has from its beginnings stood strongly against racism in any of its malignant manifestations==. President Spencer W. Kimball stated the Church’s position well: “We do wish that there would be no racial prejudice. … Racial prejudice is of the devil. … There is no place for it in the gospel of Jesus Christ” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 236–37).*

&mdash; [“No More Strangers”](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2000/09/no-more-strangers?lang=eng&id=p5-p6#p5), By Elder Alexander B. Morrison Of the Seventy, Ensign September 2000

Boy, those church leaders sure like calling racism a theory.

"We've *never* been racist."

&nbsp;

> *Racial strife still lifts its ugly head. I am advised that even right here among us there is some of this. I cannot understand how it can be. It seemed to me that ==we all rejoiced in the 1978 revelation given President Kimball==. I was there in the temple at the time that that happened. There was no doubt in my mind or in the minds of my associates that what was revealed was the mind and the will of the Lord.*
> 
> *Now I am told that racial slurs and denigrating remarks are sometimes heard among us. I remind you that ==no man who makes disparaging remarks concerning those of another race can consider himself a true disciple of Christ==. Nor can he consider himself to be in harmony with the teachings of the Church of Christ. How can any man holding the Melchizedek Priesthood arrogantly assume that he is eligible for the priesthood whereas another who lives a righteous life but whose skin is of a different color is ineligible?*

&mdash; [The Need for Greater Kindness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/04/the-need-for-greater-kindness?lang=eng&id=p7-p8#p7), President Gordon B. Hinckley, President of the Church, General Conference April 2006

So... if the prophet of God in 2006 can make this declaration, can it be retrofitted to those, say, prior to 1978? Because if so, this presents something of a conundrum. And if not, can we call the prophet authoritative?
