# 🤼 Race in Scripture
Mentioning race isn’t strictly _bad_. Calling one race bad or cursed, contrasted to “white and delightsome” is bad.

I’ve encountered this explanation:

> “Dark skin isn’t the curse! The curse is being separated from God. The dark skin was so they could tell *who had* the curse.”

Literally how is that any different

&nbsp;

The Book of Mormon itself says it is written plain and precious, so how plain is it when God says he curses the Lamanites with dark skin to make them not enticing to the Nephites? That’s pretty plain! If what the scriptures meant was that they had unattractive tattoos, I don't think the scriptures would be very ambiguous about it. Also, tattoos aren't hereditary.

&nbsp;

## Book of Mormon
> *And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and ==she was exceedingly fair and white==.*

&mdash; *[1 Nephi 11:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)*

&nbsp;

> *And it came to pass that I beheld, after ==they had dwindled in unbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations==.*

&mdash; *[1 Nephi 12:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)*

&nbsp;

> *And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance; and I beheld that ==they were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto my people== before they were slain.*

&mdash; *[1 Nephi 13:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)*

&nbsp;

> *And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, ==as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them==.*
>
> *And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that ==they shall be loathsome unto thy people==, save they shall repent of their iniquities.*
>
> *And ==cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed==; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.*

​&mdash; *[2 Nephi 5:21-23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p21-p23#p21)*

&nbsp;

> *And then shall they rejoice: for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save ==they shall be a white and a delightsome people==.*

&mdash; *[2 Nephi 30:6](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/123)*, ==Original 1830 edition==

🤔 Why would this be different in [later editions](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)?

&nbsp;

> *Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and ==the cursing which hath come upon their skins==, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father—that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them.*
>
> *And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and ==one day they shall become a blessed people==.*
>
> *Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?*
>
> *O my brethren, I fear that ==unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours==, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.*
>
> *Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.*

> *5 Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth.*
>
> *6 And ==the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren==, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, ==who were just and holy men==.*
>
> *7 And their brethren sought to destroy them, ==therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them==, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.*
>
> *8 And ==this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren,== that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.*
>
> *9 And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.*
>
> *10 Therefore, ==whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites was called under that head, and there was a mark set upon him.==*

*…*

> *14 Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: ==Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them== that ==they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed==, from this time henceforth and forever, ==except they repent of their wickedness== and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them.*
>
> *15 And again: ==I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren==, that they may be cursed also.*
>
> *16 And again: ==I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against thee and thy seed==.*
>
> *17 And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be called thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be called thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the promises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed.*

&nbsp;

> *14 And behold, they shall go unto the unbelieving of the Jews; and for this intent shall they go—that they may be persuaded that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God; that the Father may bring about, through his most Beloved, his great and eternal purpose, in restoring the Jews, or all the house of Israel, to the land of their inheritance, which the Lord their God hath given them, unto the fulfilling of his covenant;*
>
> *15 And also that the seed of this people may more fully believe his gospel, which shall go forth unto them from the Gentiles; for this people shall be scattered, and ==shall become a dark, a filthy, and a loathsome people==, beyond the description of that which ever hath been amongst us, yea, ==even that which hath been among the Lamanites==, and this because of their unbelief and idolatry.*

## Pearl of Great Price

> *For behold, the Lord shall curse the land with much heat, and the barrenness thereof shall go forth forever; and ==there was a blackness== came upon all ==the children of Canaan==, that they were despised among all people.*

...

> *And it came to pass that Enoch continued to call upon all the people, ==save it were the people of Canaan,== to repent;*

&mdash; *[Moses 7:8, 12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)*

Everyone should be called to repentance, except for those those who had "a blackness" come upon them. I guess the intended effect of being despised worked as expected.
