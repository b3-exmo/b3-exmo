# 🍽 Was it Moroni, or Nephi?
## JS History 1839 - 1841 (Draft \#2)
> Not only was his robe exceedingly white but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him I was afraid, but the fear soon left me. He called me by name and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me and that his name was Nephi. That God had a work for me to do, and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations kindreds and tongues. or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people. He said there was a book deposited written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent and the source from whence they sprang.

There is a footnote on Nephi’s name mentioned here: in short, under Brigham Young’s leadership, folks noticed discrepancy in JS’ account of these visits, and so leaders had to pick a side. I’d want to know why there was discrepancy in the first place- if this was a memorable thing that actually happened, wouldn’t JS know the messenger’s name? Did that not leave an impression?

The above quote is corroborated in [Lucy Mack Smith’s account](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/lucy-mack-smith-history-1845/86#facts). Looks like a direct quote from the above.

Above quote is also draft \#2; how worried should I be that this mis-naming was written twice?

[Draft #1 is also available](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/5#11068310980866261140). I don’t know what “fair copy” means, but [here it is a third time](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-1841-fair-copy/6).

## Maybe it was both?
### George Q Cannon
Perhaps George Q Cannon has something to say about it in 1869, as recorded in the Journal of Discourses?

Hold on to your pants, because this talk is bananas.

> If you will read the history of the Church from the beginning, you will find that Joseph was visited by various angelic beings, but not one of them professed to give him the keys until John the Baptist came to him. Moroni, who held the keys of the record of the stick of Ephraim, visited Joseph; he had doubtless, also, visits from Nephi and it may be from Alma and others, but though they came and had authority, holding the authority of the Priesthood, we have no account of their ordaining him…

The context for the above paragraph is describing why priesthood holders like Moroni & Nephi hadn’t restored that authority at the time. Describes that no authority was restored until John the Baptist had done it.

BUT KEEP READING holy shit

> we have no account of [Moroni or Nephi] ordaining him, neither did Joseph ever profess, because of the ministration of these angels, to have authority to administer in any of the ordinances of the Kingdom of God. ==He never baptized anybody==, nor attempted to lay on hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost; and, in fact, he never attempted, that we have any account of, to exercise any of the functions of the holy Priesthood. He was a prophet, it is true, but a man may be a prophet and yet not have authority to administer in the Priesthood. The prophetic gift, to some extent, is distinct from the Priesthood. Joseph had received the prophetic gift and he exercised it and he acted as such prior to his ordination. But when the time came for him to be baptized, then a man who held the keys of that Priesthood came to him and laid his hands upon Joseph’s head, and upon Oliver Cowdery, and set them apart, and gave them authority to officiate in the Aaronic Priesthood, which Priesthood held the keys of baptism and so forth.

### John Taylor, 1877

> Who was it that administered to Joseph Smith? ==Moroni and Nephi==, men who had lived upon this continent. Who from the other continent? John the Baptist for one; Peter, James, and John for others; Moses and Elias again for others, who revealed certain principles that God designed they should reveal, and imparted unto him the powers of the Priesthood which existed in the heavens, that it might be again conferred upon men on the earth, and that the blessings of the everlasting Gospel might be again restored.

### John Taylor, 1879

> Afterwards the Angel ==Moroni came to him and revealed to him the Book of Mormon==, with the history of which you are generally familiar, and also with the statements that I am now making pertaining to these things. ==And then came Nephi, one of the ancient prophets==, that had lived upon this continent, who had an interest in the welfare of the people that he had lived amongst in those days.

Looks like JT differentiated them, said both had visited independent of each other.

## Apologist explanations
It’s claimed that JS didn’t write that himself, but a scribe did, so blame the scribe. Then everyone else quoted that scribe’s account, so _really_ blame that scribe. JS did nothing wrong. It was Moroni the whole time.

Honestly, I see both sides as compelling. JS may not have always had facts straight. Maybe a scribe did goof up. But for those three drafts of the same document claiming a pivotal moment in JS’ divine authority to escape scrutiny… I think that’s a bad look.
