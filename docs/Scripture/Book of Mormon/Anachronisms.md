# ‚Åâ Anachronisms
> . . . I spoke with a good friend, not a member of the Church. He said he had ==a list of 50 anachronisms== in the Book of Mormon that demonstrated the book was a nineteenth-century invention. An anachronism refers to something that is chronologically out of place, a bit like saying Julius Caesar drove his SUV into Rome. Well, I told my friend that ==he was too late, for I had received a witness of the truth== of the Book of Mormon. But I said to him, ‚ÄúGive me your list, and I will keep it.‚Äù I did keep that list, and over the years, as more research was done by various academics, one item after another dropped off the list.
>
> A few years ago when I was speaking to a group at Cornell University, I mentioned my list and noted that, after these many years, only one item remained. After my presentation a distinguished professor said to me, ‚ÄúYou can remove your last item, for ==our studies indicate that it is not an anachronism==.‚Äù

‚Äî *[The Quest for Spiritual Knowledge](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2007/06/the-quest-for-spiritual-knowledge?lang=eng&id=p6-p7#p6)*, Elder Robert S. Wood of the Seventy, Ensign June 2007

And that good friend's name? Albert Einstein. Then everyone stood up and clapped. *I'll take "things that never happened" for 500, Alex!*

We can take cheap shots at how preposterous this story is, but the point I want to focus on is this: A member of the seventy published in the church's official magazine that 50 anachronisms in the Book of Mormon have been debunked and disproven by a nameless "distinguished professor" at Cornell. That's a bold claim. It is measurable and demonstrable.

*Show us the list, then!* If this story happened, wouldn't the church proudly present the counter-arguments that disprove the claims of those critics? The last paragraph of that excerpt suggests to me that Elder Wood addressed 49 out of 50, and the last one was studied by this "distinguished professor" enough for him to dismiss it. Elder Wood, you are making provable claims. *Prove them.*

We reportedly have concrete information that proves critics wrong, thereby demonstrating that the Book of Mormon is of divine origin. This would be enough to draw public attention worldwide! What are the anachronisms, and what are the counterpoints that convince nameless faces at Cornell that this scripture is not a "19th century invention"?

Nothing? We just gotta work it out through faith? *Why did you tell us this story, then?*

## Apostasy
How there could be an apostasy (no priesthood on the earth) if the 3 Nephites and John were still alive? Presumably they‚Äôre still around; what have they been doing for 1800 years? Those four were priesthood holders, right?

I suppose they didn't have the "office" of priesthood to qualify... ü§∑ I guess Jesus dropped the ball on that one whoops lmao

## Seeing God
The brother of Jared is described as having like the most faith ever, and so he was able to [see God‚Äôs finger](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p6-p8#p6)‚Ä¶ but Joseph Smith literally just prayed once and he got to see both Heavenly Father and Jesus. Their full bodies. Should we believe this means Joseph was super, uber, ultra-special faithful prior to the [[First Vision|first vision(s)]]?

## Jaredites
### Timeline
>_The Book of Mormon Jaredite King List gives only 7 exact dates (lifespans and reigns) for the Jaredite Chronology. The only real markers we have to build a working chronology from are firstly, the date of the ‚Äúdearth‚Äù or famine and megafauna extinction given in the narrative of Heth [Ether 9:30‚Äì34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p30-p34#p30). It‚Äôs important to note that it‚Äôs well established that Mastodons and other megafauna went extinct in most of continental North America at about 11 - 8,000 BC and the paleoindians role in killing them off and eating them amidst a major climate event (as explained in [Ether 9:30‚Äì34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p30-p34#p30)) is well documented in the archaeological record, so we must consider the possibility that if radiocarbon dates are not off (which they certainly may be for that period), then there is likely a large unknown break of thousands of years between the Jared to Heth, and the rest of the timeline._

### How many people died?
>*He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly [two millions](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng#note2a) of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children.*

‚Äî [Ether 15:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)

Perhaps not all two million were married. Perhaps not all men were of age to fight a hand-to-hand war.

Make a broad generalization that maybe they were: two million mighty men + two million wives + (averaged?) two and a half million children means for just the families of age to fight, we‚Äôre at six million people. This won‚Äôt count those too elderly to fight, or the civilization & infrastructure to support those who did not fight (need city governance and whatnot, I guess?)

Maybe I could extrapolate another 1 million for those not in the fight? Too old? Too young? Children were already counted, so‚Ä¶ maybe 7.5 million. Seven and a half million people and no signs at all of their existence, less than two thousand years ago.

Let‚Äôs compare that to battle deaths on the _western front_ in the First World War. In 4 years, about 4 million men died on the western front. That‚Äôs 4 years of intense artillery fire, machine guns, accurate rifles, poison gas, etc.

Actually, you know what‚Äî six to seven million is a number that has a pretty direct comparison to the [number of Jewish people killed during the holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe). To be clear, the only comparison I'm making here is the number of deaths, no further implications than that scale. Imagine numerous deaths on the scale of the 1940's holocaust, possibly greater, just... poofing away.

The idea that a bronze age civilizations would be capable of inflicting death on that scale‚Äî especially without leaving a trace‚Äî is patently absurd. The fact that the _entire civilization_ conveniently annihilated itself before the Nephites arrived is even more ridiculous.

### Wooden Submarines
Jaredites in wooden submarines. Jaredites with steel. Did [[Technology|steel]] technology exist in 8000 BCE?

Giving this any amount of critical evaluation makes it sound more ridiculous than inspiring or faith-promoting. No propulsion, no steering, constant flipping, no food stores, no potable water, no waste disposal, and no solid way to tell time or know how long it took. I'm not sure they knew how to measure the number of days- did they write it down, or just talk out a consensus once they made landfall? If it was written, what was it recorded on?

BoM describes Jaredites as having been ‚Äú[led by God from the Tower of Babel to the Americas](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/jaredites)‚Äù, which would place them in Babylon in Iraq. I‚Äôm open to correction, but my google-sleuthing led me to the Tower of Babel being in [Iraq, near Baghdad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YTsXjXz2s3otx2Ri9). I hope I'm not being bamboozled by some kind of tourist attraction.

Personally, I've never hiked more than ~5 miles in a day, with adequate hydration, modern footwear, etc. I don‚Äôt know how feasible it is to travel from [Baghdad, Iraq to Beirut, Lebanon](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Beirut,+Lebanon/Baghdad,+Baghdad+Governorate,+Iraq) (~580 miles of desert), or [to Tel Aviv, Israel](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Tel+Aviv,+Israel/Baghdad,+Baghdad+Governorate,+Iraq) (~650 miles of desert), but that sounds non-trivial to me.

Then comes the Atlantic. Closest point by my eyeball estimation is Cape Cod in Mass. If they went in a straight line, it would be 3433 miles. 2700+3433 = 6133 miles.

[Ether 6:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) records the duration of time as being 344 days. 6133 miles is a low estimate, straight lines. 6133 / 344 = ~17.8285. Assuming they had propulsion, navigation and steering, I might call that speed of 18 miles per day ‚Äúnot unreasonable.‚Äù However. It‚Äôs nearly a year of constant flipping around with only glowing stones as light. What did their animals eat for a year? 

I've heard the critical claim that the deseret beehives were in the barges as well- by my understanding, the bees were explicitly mentioned on the coast as the barges were being built, and never mentioned after. Were the hives brought along? Maybe. I hope not, I wouldn't want to be in a flipping submarine with stinging insects. That's one point that [[Sources and Links|FAIR]] and I can [agree on](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:Did_the_Jaredites_bring_swarms_of_bees_across_the_ocean_in_their_barges).

Nephi & friends were able to invoke divine intervention so they wouldn‚Äôt have to cook their meat. That necessitates they still had to acquire the meat, though. I suppose the Jaredites got some fish when the barge flipped? How did they handle waste? A month in, every square inch of the inside would be covered in poop. An hour in and they've got some stressed livestock, probably trying to break out.

## Animals
Horses indigenous to America had been made extinct by the ice age, and were absent from America before Christopher Columbus. How, then, do we handle Nephi's account that [there are horses standing around in plain sight](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p25#p25), alive and well, as soon as they land in America?  [Or were they tapirs](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Animals/Horses/Loanshifting:_deer_and_tapirs)?

Animals indigenous to the Americas:

- Black bears
- Brown bears
- Jaguar
- Bald Eagle
- Llamas
- Cougars
- Coyotes
- Bison
- Anaconda
- Alligator
- [Tapir](https://byustudies.byu.edu/article/animals-in-the-book-of-mormon-challenges-and-perspectives/)

Animals not indigenous to Americas:
- Horses ([1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p9-p10#p9), [3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p1#p1), [4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng), [5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20?lang=eng&id=p6#p6), [6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p25#p25))
- Lions ([1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/20?lang=eng&id=p10#p10), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p12#p12))
- Dragons ([1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p44#p44), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/20?lang=eng&id=p11#p11))

Take a guess which lists‚Äô animals appear in the Book of Mormon, of ancient Americas?

What does [lds.org](http://lds.org) say about animals? [Not much](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2008/08/for-little-friends/book-of-mormon-animals?lang=eng).
