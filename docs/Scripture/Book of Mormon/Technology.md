# ðŸ¤– Technology
## Steel
> Iron production began in Anatolia about 2000 bc, and the Iron Age was well established by 1000 bc. The technology of iron making then spread widely; by 500 bc it had reached the western limits of Europe, and by 400 bc it had reached China. Iron ores are widely distributed, and the other raw material, charcoal, was readily available. The iron was produced in small shaft furnaces as solid lumps, called blooms, and these were then hot forged into bars of wrought iron, a malleable material containing bits of slag and charcoal.

The brittleness can be decreased by reheating the steel within the range of 350Â° to 500Â° C (660Â° to 930Â° F), in a process known as tempering. This type of heat treatment was ==known to the Egyptians by 900 bc==, as can be judged by the microstructure of remaining artifacts, and formed the basis of a steel industry for producing a material that was ideally suited to the fabrication of **swords and knives**.

I donâ€™t think this strictly precludes Jaredites having steel, but it does look like theyâ€™re around 1500 years too early to claim they had steel as we know it today. Very likely they had iron.

One could argue that theyâ€™re calling it steel, and weâ€™d call it iron today.

Either this is the most correct book on the planet, or itâ€™s not.

### _Steel swords_
> *Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did molten out of the hill, and made ==swords out of steel== for those whom he had drawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he returned to the city Nehor, and gave battle unto his brother Corihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom and restored it unto his father Kib.*

â€” _[Ether 7:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)_

>*And again, they have brought ==swords==, the hilts thereof have perished, and the ==blades thereof were cankered with rust==; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates. Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate?*

â€” _[Mosiah 8:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8?lang=eng&id=p11#p11)_

Where are all of the iron slag piles from this iron/steel swords that were made in the New world during the Book of Mormon times? That byproduct would be very hard to miss. Primitive America probably didn't have a way to ecologically dispose of it, to hide it from us today.

## Paper
> *And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire; and they also brought forth their ==records which contained the holy scriptures==, and ==cast them into the fire also==, that they might be burned and destroyed by fire.*

â€” _[Alma 14:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)_

Burning their records? This isn't explicitly stated as being written on paper, but... brass plates aren't going to burn so easily. I'm quite certain that printing presses didn't exist, so presumably this was written by hand. On... papyrus? Did they have that technology? Honest question, I don't have an answer for this one.
