# 👩‍🤝‍👩 Polygamy
## Required for exaltation!
> It is the word of the Lord, and I wish to say to you, and all the world, that if you desire with all your hearts to obtain the blessings which Abraham obtained, ==you will be polygamists at least in your faith, or you will come short of enjoying the salvation and the glory which Abraham has obtained. This is as true as that God lives.==

> . . . The man that [resists polygamy] in his heart, and will continue to persist in pursuing that policy, will come short of dwelling in the presence of the Father and the Son, in celestial glory.

> ==The only men who [[Becoming Gods|become Gods]], even the Sons of God, are those who enter into polygamy==. Others attain unto a glory and may even be permitted to come into the presence of the Father and the Son; but they cannot reign as kings in glory, because they had blessings offered unto them, and they refused to accept them.

> Celestial marriage is for the fullness of the glory of god. It is the crowning glory. ==A man has no right to one wife unless he is worthy of two==. . . . There is no provision made for those who have had the chance & [opportunity] and have disregarded that law. Men who disregard that law are in the same situation as if they broke any other law. they are transgressors.

This is the account given by Isaiah, whether he told the truth or not I leave every body to judge for himself.”

## Building up population

Are you sure? I’ve encountered many insistent explanations that when Joseph Smith practiced polygamy, there was no boinking involved.

If Polygamy was just about building up population, wouldn’t you think there would be record of Adam having [multiple “Eve’s”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith)? That’s when human population was lowest, and to carry out God’s purposes if giving us all physical bodies, expediting that process would require more than one woman. Plenty of souls had human bodies in 1830, but still, LDS church leaders needed to be blessed with multiple wives. **Don’t tell me it was to build population.**

Brigham Young did teach that Adam had multiple wives, which detail was omitted from Genesis and Pearl of Great Price, and temple ceremonies. Can both be true?

Polygamy being only about population can likely be traced to Jacob 2:30:

> “For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.”

Don’t exclude verse 27, though:

> “Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;”

## Ages, Census analysis

Marrying fourteen-year-olds is not normal today. Don’t tell me It was normal in Joseph Smith’s time, though.

I’ll concede that yes, humans under 18 did get married, even at ages like 14. However. Fourteen-year-olds did not get married to men in their mid-thirties. Did not get married to religious clergy with such a power dynamic and imbalance.

Teenagers got married to other teenagers, not to the lord’s mouthpiece at threat of death and destruction, and the promise of exaltation for complying.

&nbsp;

> **“But there were fewer men than women! Women couldn’t own properties so widows needed to double up.”**

— The explanation I had been told all throughout seminary

US Census Bureau didn’t have granular detail in the 1800’s, but it’s got enough aggregate data for us to determine if something fits a pattern. The granularity did get better with subsequent decades, but it was a bit vague early on.

Integrated Public Use Microdata Series ([https://usa.ipums.org/usa/](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/)) has census records you can download and analyze yourself.

&nbsp;

The 1850 and the 1880 census has the age and marriage status of each person but doesn’t have the age at which they were married.  They have two data points that you can try and guess the marriage age.  The first is a field for “Married in the last year”.  If that is checked, then the person’s age is most likely their age when they were married.  The second is a field for “Age of eldest child”.  Subtracting that from the parents age gives a really rough estimate of marriage age.

The 1900 census also has the age and marriage status but it also has a field for “Years of marriage”.  Subtracting that from the age should give the marriage age.

Based off that data, here’s the numbers that I got:

- **1850 census:**
    - Total married women for the USA: 3,156,838.
    - Total married women under 18: 39,907 (1.3%).
    - Total married women who gave birth before 18: 269,997 (8.6%)
- **1880 census**:
    - Total married women for the USA: 8,433,603.
    - Total married women under 18: 68,473 (0.8%).
    - Total married women who gave birth before 18: 649,562 (7.7%)
- **1900 census** (this is a 5% sampling of the actual census):
    - Total married women for the USA: 671,976.
    - Total married women under 18: 5,310 (0.8%).
    - Total married women who were married before 18: 107, 283 (16%)

### My analysis

I did get the census data for 1830 to do some cursory number crunching (as one does). Given the time period, black and white men and women are four different categories. I’ve summed up white male and white female, in buckets of 15 - 19; 20 - 29; 30 - 39; 40 - 49; Here’s what I found:

|              | 15 - 19 | 20 - 29 | 30 - 39 | 40 - 49 | Total     |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| M            | 573,196 | 956,487 | 592,535 | 367,840 | 2,490,058 |
| F            | 596,254 | 918,411 | 555,531 | 356,046 | 2,426,242 |
| M to F Ratio | 0.96    | 1.04    | 1.07    | 1.03    | 1.03      |

There were more men than women in this subset of fertile age ranges, among white census respondents.

This directly contradicts the apologetic that I’ve heard that due to warfare and poor sanitation that there were more women than men, and they weren’t legally allowed to own a home, therefore polygamy was for charitable purposes. No. This is empirical evidence that the reverse is true.

This does not mean that in places like Kirtland or Palmyra that the populations matched this exact ratio, but it’s the best indicator I can really hope for. Across America, those aged over 20, there were about 40,000 more men. The idea that women were vulnerable and houseless is not far-fetched, but Brigham Young taking fifty wives for charitable purposes only does not work. I will not believe it.

US Census Bureau started tracking in 1890, and shows the average age for women getting married was 22. Grown adult men marrying sixteen year olds was not normal in the United States. In the church, it was.

&nbsp;

### SPECULATION ALERT
This is me thinking out loud, I don’t have data to back this up.

US Population at the time had more men than women. If in 1838, you hear a missionary tell you that a man can have a religious sanction to be part of polygamy, who is going to jump up and down with excitement? I suppose that women weren’t really stoked about it. How many women were dragged into it by their husbands, due to their lack of rights? A majority of marriage-age women who converted to the early church were already married. Those who did not convert were either born into it, or thought polygamy was a stupid arrangement, so they did not convert.

In early church membership there were more men than women (see above). Polygamy was not about charity, giving them shelter and food. It was about sex.

## Angel with a Sword vs Joseph Smith
> “When God commands a difficult task, He sometimes sends additional messengers to encourage His people to obey. Consistent with this pattern, Joseph told associates that an angel appeared to him three times between 1834 and 1842 and commanded him to proceed with plural marriage when he hesitated to move forward. During the third and final appearance, the angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.”

— _[Gospel Topics Essay: Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng)_

I can think of no other time in church history that a religious leader was threatened with a violent death from God if he did not follow a commandment, let alone a commandment that was morally dubious at best, and goes against social & cultural norms. “I’ve got to do this illegal thing, or else an angel with a sword that only I saw will destroy me!”

Footnote to cite the above claim is as follows:

>See Brian C. Hales, “Encouraging Joseph Smith to Practice Plural Marriage: The Accounts of the Angel with a Drawn Sword,” Mormon Historical Studies 11, no. 2 (Fall 2010): 69–70.

I did end up [[#Corroborating claimants|finding the source]] for this.

Other note in that essay:

> “Although the Lord commanded the adoption—and later the cessation—of plural marriage in the latter days, He did not give exact instructions on how to obey the commandment.”

Well golly gee if only we had a spokesperson for God who could obtain and interpret His will

> So in the face of multiple anxieties, what might have prompted Joseph Smith to move forward personally and once again marry polygamously and teach others to do likewise? Several writers left accounts from the Nauvoo period that Joseph told of an angel with a sword who threatened him if he did not proceed.
>
> Several accounts relate how Joseph appeared to have felt genuine fear at the time. Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner recalled that the sword-threat was not symbolic: ==“Joseph told me that he was afraid when the angel appeared to him and told him to take other wives. He hesitated, and the angel appeared to him the third time with a drawn sword in his hand and threatened his life if he did not fulfill the commandment.”== Erastus Snow claimed that Joseph had “to plead on his knees before the Angel for his Life.” On another occasion, Joseph reportedly affirmed: “God commanded me to obey it [plural marriage]. He said to me that unless I accept it and introduce it, and practice it, I, together with my people, should be damned and cut off from this time henceforth.

Seems odd to me that the pivotal figure in restoring the church would be “damned and cut off” after having founded the church, if he didn’t do this one particular thing that his family and peers disapproved of.

> The time arrived; but Joseph, in virtuous desperation, concluded rather to flee the city than be the medium of communicating a matter so repugnant to his mind. He mounted his horse and galloped from the town, but was met by an angel with a drawn sword, and threatened with instant destruction unless he immediately returned and fulfilled his mission.

I can’t claim to understand motivation or reasoning behind this, but that seems pretty uncharacteristic of God to arrange that encounter. [God’s work cannot be frustrated](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1), _unless_ the one individual called to restore the Gospel hesitates when being told to get bangin' your wife.

## “Well, if he fuckin’, then why no [babby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39lHPHs8bV8)?”
It seems to me that we don’t have _solid_ info as to why, but we have a lot of suspicious circumstantial evidence.

Consider some possible reasons.

1. JS et al did not engage in polygamy (does not appear to be the case)
2. Plural marriage(s) never were consummated (appears false; Emma probably wouldn’t have had such a strong reaction if it was only domestic)
3. Plan B! Abort, abort!

John C Bennett was in the equivalent of the church’s first presidency at Nauvoo. He was a physician, a trained obstetrician, and is on record as having propositioned women with the following stipulation:

> … he had promised to give his victims “medicine to produce abortions, providing they should become pregnant.”

— _[Joseph Smith, John C. Bennett, and the Extradition Attempt, 1842](https://rsc.byu.edu/joseph-smith-prophet-seer/joseph-smith-john-c-bennett-extradition-attempt-1842)_, BYU Religious Studies Center

**I haven’t encountered any direct evidence** that Bennett did perform abortions, but for him to be so close to Joseph Smith and being willing to perform abortions for Joseph seems likely.

&nbsp;

The 19th century is in a modern era, where humans understand that sex = babies. If an unexplained number of pregnancies showed up surrounding Joseph, people would get suspicious. The point is to be discreet. They didn’t want babies, that would blow their cover.

One way to circumvent suspicion is to engage in [polyandry](https://mit.irr.org/chart-of-joseph-smiths-plural-wives), or coital behavior with women who were already married. That way, there’s plausible deniability for extramarital affairs.

Contraception methods in the 1830’s might not be quite as sophisticated today, but… did they understand ovulation cycles to avoid conception? I can't really say with confidence.

Sex doesn’t 100% result in conception every time, as I understand it, there are numerous factors at play. The absence of children does not mean there never were any extramarital affairs. It’s an indication, yes, but not a bulletproof refutation, either.

## Conflicting accounts
There are numerous documents to suggest that Joseph Smith did not practice polygamy. There also exist many documents to suggest that he did. There exists documentary evidence that later church leaders (Young, Taylor, etc) retrofitted Joseph’s revelations like [[DC 132]] to endorse polygamous behavior post-mortem.

We can banter about that until we’re blue in the face. What is **not** be up for debate is the prurient, predatory behavior of subsequent church leaders like Brigham Young and John Taylor.

This presents a real dilemma. That dilemma will be further explored in the note section on the Succession Crisis.

Let’s assume that accusations against JS are exaggerated or outright fabricated. We then have to contend with the 2nd and 3rd presidents of the church.

Did God command _them_ to do it? Did they use JS as justification? If there was explicit revelation from God to do that, do we have a record of it? General conference, Journal of Discourses, D&C entry, book of commandments, anything of the sort?

If no, then we have a problem.

If yes, *we still have a problem*.

We can justifiably go with the explanation that Joseph Smith was called of God to restore the one true church, irrespective of the slanderous accusations against Smith. Does that mean that Brigham Young tarnished that divine authoritative lineage?

If so, the church as it stands today has strayed from the prophet called directly by God. That would mean we should stop giving those fundamentalists the side-eye, and give them some credible evaluation.
