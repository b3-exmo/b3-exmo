## Race
### You were not worthy to be in the church

> *EDITOR’S NOTE Blacks who have joined the Mormon Church have had varied experiences and harbor contrasting views about the church which once excluded them from full participation. Here is a sampling, based on Associated Press interviews and material taken from the LDS Afro-American Oral History Project of the Charles Redd Center at Brigham Young University:*

>> *WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah – Natalie Palmer-Taylor had never experienced racism among Mormons until she moved to Utah.*  
>>
>> *When her son was the target of a racial epithet hurled by another Mormon youth, she went to the church’s headquarters to complain. She was met by Ezra Taft Benson, the president of the church who then was leader of the faith’s Council of the Twelve Apostles.*  
>>
>> *“I was full of hate; I was really, really angry,” Ms. Palmer-Taylor said. “==Ezra Taft Benson said, ‘If you allow the people of the church to turn you against the church, then you were not worthy to be in the church in the first place=='”*

## Trust not in the arm of flesh
> *Such timely counsel could help save our country from Communism, as the same masters of deceit are showing the same false solicitude for the unfortunate in the name of civil rights.*
> 
> *Now there is nothing wrong with civil rights; it is what's being done in the name of civil rights that is alarming.*
> 
> *==There is no doubt that the so-called civil rights movement as it exists today is used as a Communist program for revolution in America== just as agrarian reform was used by the Communists to take over China and Cuba.*

— [Trust Not in the Arm of Flesh](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#:t621:g889), Elder Ezra Taft Benson of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, General Conference 1967 October

Context for what he calls "timely counsel" can be found in the provided link. My summary is it's a quote from who I assume is the First Presidency in... 1942? Their words seem to be a warning against *secret combinations*™, which Benson is A) extrapolating to mean communists in the Civil Rights movement, and B) timely counsel, 25 years displaced. Go see for yourself, tell me if there's a more charitable way to present that information.

## Dept of Agriculture
Today, I have my suspicions for why the only interesting things I'd heard about Benson was that, prior to being an apostle, then prophet, was that he worked as the secretary of the US Department of Agriculture ([1](https://www.deseret.com/2015/2/7/20558060/ezra-taft-benson-champion-of-cooperative-agriculture/), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/ezra-taft-benson?lang=eng), [3](https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/exhibit/prophets-of-the-restoration-ezra-taft-benson?lang=eng), [4](https://rsc.byu.edu/prophets-apostles-last-dispensation/ezra-taft-benson)). I suppose it'd do well to know what kind of things happened while he was in a position of influence in that office between January 21, 1953 – January 20, 1961 ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Taft_Benson#Political_career)).

> On September 21, ==1959==, [P.L.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_law "Public law") 86-341 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to operate a food-stamp system through January 31, 1962. ==The [Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower "Dwight D. Eisenhower") Administration never used the authority==. . . . President [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy")'s first Executive Order called for expanded food distribution and, ==on February 2, 1961==, he announced that food stamp pilot programs would be initiated.

The department of agriculture was given authorization to feed the hungry and poor during Benson's tenure. The department only made use of that authorization two weeks *after* Benson left the office. I concede that I wasn't there to confirm the goings-on in the background, and it's likely very evident that I don't know jack squat about political offices. But I can point out that, when in a position to feed the hungry and poor, Ezra Taft Benson did not do it. I won't be convinced that it's a matter of red tape and regulations; his office was fully authorized in 1959, and it never went anywhere until Benson left office a good 16 months after the fact. True follower of Christ? Am I being unfair?
