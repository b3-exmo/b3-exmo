Does not appear to be an officially sanctioned site

[https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/)

Unofficial apologetics site; attempts to address difficult questions and controversies. Provides primary sources for problematic documents.
... It's maybe unofficial. I've encountered claims that writers for the game are paid by the church, but I haven't really looked into that.

Appears to be part of official church domain.

When you first load up and select the search bar, this popup appears:

Media publications. PDFs of scripture, proclamations, manuals, president teachings, etc

## JSPP

Establish legitimacy of later sources:

Official LDS Newsroom opens this announcement by saying:

“The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced today the establishment of The Church Historian’s Press, a new imprint for publishing works related to the Church’s origin and growth.”

[https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/) is part of this domain.

Both The Church Historian’s Press and Joseph Smith Papers appear to be legitimate, LDS leadership-owned sources of information.
