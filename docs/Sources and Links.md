This page is pretty messy. Come in and look around if you like! Hopefully by next time you stop by, it'll feel more coherent.

[lds-general-conference.org](https://www.lds-general-conference.org/): Does not appear to be an officially sanctioned site

edit:
whoops, nevermind, [looks like it might be](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/quick-tip-finding-older-general-conference-talks?lang=eng) after all

[fairlatterdaysaints.org](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/): FAIR, Faithful Answers & Informed Responses, is an unofficial apologetics site; attempts to address difficult questions and controversies. Provides primary sources for problematic documents. The De Facto standard for defending The Truth ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è from those evildoers.

... It's maybe unofficial. I've encountered claims that writers for the game are paid by the church, but I haven't looked into it to verify those claims.

[catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/): Appears to be part of official church domain.

When you first load up and select the search bar, this popup appears:

lol. lmao.

[churchofjesuschrist.org/media/publications](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/publications?lang=eng): Media publications. PDFs of scripture, proclamations, manuals, president teachings, etc

[Utah Lighthouse Ministry](http://www.utlm.org/), abbreviated to UTLM. Looks to be the official site of Jerald & Sandra Tanner, two notorious critics of the LDS church's truth claims.
## Joseph Smith Papers Project

Establish legitimacy of later sources:

[Official LDS Newsroom](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/new-publishing-imprint-set-to-boost-mormon-scholarship) opens this announcement by saying:

>‚ÄúThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced today the establishment of The Church Historian‚Äôs Press, a new imprint for publishing works related to the Church‚Äôs origin and growth.‚Äù

[https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/) is part of this domain.

Both The Church Historian‚Äôs Press and Joseph Smith Papers appear to be legitimate, LDS leadership-owned sources of information.

## [Deseret Management Corporation](https://www.deseretmanagement.com/#our-companies)
>Deseret Management Corporation (DMC) is a for-profit company affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

[Deseret Management, _Careers_](https://www.deseretmanagement.com/careers)

One could rightfully argue that "affiliated with" doesn't mean "owned by." It'd be a shame if one of its subsidiaries [[#Deseret News|outright stated that DMC is owned by the church]], wouldn't it?
### Deseret Digital Media
[Owns KSL](https://www.deseretdigital.com/ksl-news) and its subsidiaries
[Owns Utah.com](https://www.deseretdigital.com/utah-dotcom), tourism site
### Deseret News
>The Deseret News is a subsidiary of the [Deseret Management Corporation](http://www.deseretmanagement.com/), which is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

[About Us](https://www.deseret.com/pages/about-us/), Deseret News

### So what?
Disregarding all the times I'd been assured that Deseret News / Book was not owned by the church, the idea that a religion has a for-profit branch doesn't sit well with me. I thought religions were meant to operate by donation?

Being owned by the church itself carries some connotations- I'm not going to imply that every KSL article is screened & approved by the 12 apostles, but the connection is close enough for us common folk to read a level of complicity in what Deseret Book publishes. I don't presently know much about their quality control process, but Deseret wouldn't publish things the Church would vehemently disagree with, would it? It's not an independent business, it's owned by the corporate office of the LDS Church.

## Journal of Discourses

[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng)

LDS official topic essays, saying JoD is not an official publication, but it does have doctrinal teachings of early church leaders.

> *‚ÄúIt included some doctrinal instruction but also practical teaching, some of which is speculative in nature and some of which is only of historical interest.‚Äù*

Some of it is legitimate, some of it is not; we won‚Äôt specify what is reliable, just want plausible deniability when something uncomfortable comes up. Lots of non-committal language, acknowledging that JoD exists, and you could go find it if you really wanted to.

Found three or four sites online that have JoD published, but elected to reference Byu‚Äôs scriptural library; BYU is owned and funded by the LDS corporate office

## Other non-official materials
[A Careful Examination](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/): Looks like another Github Pages compendium of LDS-adjacent notes

[LDS Discussions](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/): Fantastic, well-researched dives into a variety of topics. Those pages are awfully long, so get comfy before reading

[Thoughts on things and stuff](https://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/topics/): Sounds vague, feels like a muse for doctrinal thoughts

[Mormonism under the microscope](https://www.mormonismunderthemicroscope.com/): I haven't explored them much, looks like a topical document for various claims / controversies

[Zelph on the Shelf](https://zelphontheshelf.com/): One of the early blogs I encountered that offers critical insights of LDS doctrine. As of 2024 March, appears to be offline- hoping it comes back in the future ü•∫
Bonus link: [The Millennials' Brief Guide to the CES Letter](https://zelphontheshelf.com/the-millennials-brief-guide-to-the-ces-letter/) is one I encountered early on (late 2018) when i was trying to find some "both sides" analyses of the [CES Letter](https://read.cesletter.org/).

Speaking of, there's also plenty of material that claims to [debunk the CES Letter](https://debunking-cesletter.com/). 

[floodlit.org](https://floodlit.org/): Info on sexual abusers & coverups within LDS church

### Podcasts
#### Mormonish Podcast
I've picked up several one-off episodes from this show. Good stuff. I first encountered them in early 2024, they had a nice episode on the holiday season [giving machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zovxV6_eD2Y). I appreciated their approach being critical but fair‚Äî in this example, those machines are not malevolent, nefarious devices for money laundering (one extreme end of the spectrum), nor are they philanthropic saviors of mankind, but... somewhere in the middle. It's enough to raise some eyebrows, and I appreciated their assessment feeling not-so-harsh. Like many things in the LDS faith, there's good to be found, but there's also some shady business going on behind the curtains.

I've begun listening to their [playlist on the Gospel Topics Essays](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzh1qiLbCcydDdc2ZiCOuYDbkPN_Yp-PW), but haven't gotten through all of them yet. Each installment is close to two hours long, and yet they're not exhaustive. I'd call them approachable, and satisfying one's want for commiserating after you've already settled on a conclusion. YMMV. 4/5 stars? Good stuff, give them a listen, and find some other areas of interest in their catalog.

#### Mormon Stories Podcast
On [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@mormonstories)

I think [[My own experience|in mid-2018]], when my [[Shelf|shelf]] was creaking under the weight of unanswered questions, I saw a billboard in Salt Lake advertising the show. Not knowing much at the time, I found their webpage, and I think I got intimidated by the click-bait style episode titles initially.

My experience with this show has been quite positive- at the time of writing this, they've got just under 1900 episodes. Many of them that I've listened to are exactly what the show's name implies‚Äî they're interviews with folks' experience in Mormonsim. My wife has told me that she finds Mormon Stories to be therapeutic, validating, and emotional, as she empathizes with the show guests and their stories. I've inclined more toward their doctrinal episodes, particularly the [subseries with LDS Discussions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxq5opj6GqOACG_xU4IZiQxnhcoqlCrdI). Good stuff. Absolutely worth the time to dive in and listen to. There's something for everyone in their vast catalog of episodes, just search for some keywords.

This show also exposed me to others like John Larsen's Mormon Expression, and Radio Free Mormon.

#### John Larsen / Mormon Expression
Looks like this show formally ended in 2014. Larsen has been a semi-frequent guest on Mormon Stories. What I like most about Larsen is that he 'retires' more than once. His Mormon Expression show came to a close, and in Larsen's later episodes of hosting it, he comments something along the lines of "there's a great, big, beautiful world out there. Get out of here and enjoy it." I imagine myself having that same sentiment at some future point in my deconstruction. Mormonism is this never-ending, deep well of nonsense and shenanigans to marvel over. At some point, Larsen appears to have drawn the line, having said what he feels needs to have been said, and now focuses on gardening and homesteading. Good on you, buddy.

That is, until he comes back, as if to say "and *one more thing*...!" by appearing on John Dehlin's Mormon Stories show. Still with some hot takes and compelling insights. I like how Larsen will get really fired up over a given topic, but still has the emotional capacity to empathize with actively practicing LDS folks. Hearing [this particular tirade](https://www.youtube.com/live/yMUIgzrM4WQ?si=QX2HUURZuUnCI4Sm&t=4770) really shaped my respect for him, where he becomes emotional while telling the audience to have compassion and patience with LDS folks. He has the sentiment of "they're trying their best, and legitimately believe something even if you don't." Shoutout to Larsen, he's a real keeper. He infrequently appears once in a while, and it's always a treat to listen to.
