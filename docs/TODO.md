# üóíÔ∏è TODO
## Functional

- [ ] Book of Mormon Edition Changes
- [ ] Readability
	- [ ] Ellipses correction
	- [ ] Indentation

I'm not entirely certain, but I think I might be using ellipses improperly for a text medium. Ought to check.

Also, indenting paragraphs should make the notes feel a lot less like a wall of text rambles.

## Topics
### To be added
I have notes on these topics, but they aren't in a presentable condition. They'll need some attention and polish before publishing them. It's low-hanging fruit for me to process them and add them, just... I have a day job, is all. I'll get to it.
