# üóíÔ∏è TODO
## Functional

- [ ] [[BoM Changes#Enumeration of Changes|Book of Mormon Edition Changes]]
- [ ] Readability
	- [ ] Ellipses correction
	- [ ] Indentation
- [x] Static Navigation (w/ emoji)

I'm not entirely certain, but I think I might be using ellipses improperly for a text medium. Ought to check.

Also, indenting paragraphs should make the notes feel a lot less like a wall of text rambles.

## Topics
For many of these topics, I do have some existing notes, but they aren't in a presentable condition. Others, I've yet to write down some thoughts on. I have a day job, is all. I'll get to it.
