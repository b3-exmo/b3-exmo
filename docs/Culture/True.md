# ✅ True

> *And I know that ==the record which I make is [true](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng#note3a)==; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.*

— [1 Nephi 1:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng), Book of Mormon

&nbsp;

> *==Mormonism is truth==; and every man who embraced it felt himself at liberty to embrace every truth: consequently the shackles of superstition, bigotry, ignorance, and priestcraft, falls at once from his neck; and his eyes are opened to see the truth, and truth greatly prevails over priestcraft.*

— Joseph Smith; Letter to Isaac Galland, 22 March 1839, p. 53, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed May 26, 2024, [https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-isaac-galland-22-march-1839/3](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-isaac-galland-22-march-1839/3)

It's not only just generally accepted, it is demonstrated over and over again in the advanced material.

## Definition
When we hear the word "true," what does that really mean?
As much distaste as I feel for the trope of introducing a word's definition as part of a thesis (see also LDS sacrament meetings), some cursory searches online define *true* as:

- in accordance with the actual state of affairs
- in accordance with fact or reality
- not false
- being what exists, rather than what was thought, intended, or stated

I grew up in the LDS faith, and so I can't really speak to the experience of other religions. But this does make me wonder, do Catholic church attendees hear a testimony that the Catholic church is true, or is it assumed? Would the priest be safe to assume that "if you congregants are here listening to me, you don't need for me to convince you that it's true"? Do Jehovah's Witnesses do this? Do Muslims do this?

What does a *true* church even mean? Does that mean it has not tried to obscure information? Does that mean it is internally consistent? Does that mean it is in harmony with Christ's teachings, or that it has not strayed from His word as recorded in the four Gospels?

### Opposition
> *And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look, and behold that great and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, whose founder is the devil.*
> 
> *And he said unto me: Behold there are save ==two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil==; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations;*

— [1 Nephi 14:9-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p9-p10#p9)

&nbsp;

My first reaction to the above passage is that it's a prime example of a [[Logical Fallacies#False Dilemma|false dilemma]] logical fallacy. This is oversimplifying something to two possible outcomes. In the above example, "the church" can either be backed and authorized by God, or founded by the devil and has a maternal affinity for non-specific abominations.

My next thought is that this doctrine wants to categorize everything outside of the LDS faith as being led by an evil force, in opposition to the one organization outside of that broad category. Maybe when this angel speaking to Nephi says "church," he doesn't mean "church" as we understand it today. If this is the case, that conflicts with the idea of it being [[Scripture/Book of Mormon/index#Written for our day|written for our day]], but I digress. Is this angel suggesting that every branch, sect and offshoot of Christianity is borne of Satan, with only one exception? Does "the church of the devil" includes everything that is not the modern Brighamite sect of the LDS church? If so, why? Why would one "church" be plural, but the other "church" is singular? Are all Eastern religions founded by Christianity's boogeyman? What does this suggest about [offshoots from the LDS church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_denominations_in_the_Latter_Day_Saint_movement), founded by Joseph Smith? Did their founder change?

This dualistic all-or-nothing approach seems to oversimplify what humans find value in. "This one is *true*, therefore *everything else* is false." Not a little bit false, either, but led by Satan and will 100% certainly lead its adherents to eternal damnation and torment.

What fortuitous timing this is! I'm writing these notes in May of 2024, and the upcoming edition of the LDS church's magazine Liahona (formally Ensign) has an address specifically about this very topic. I wrote up some notes on it, but found my comments to be much more numerous than I expected. They're kept in a separate note, you can [[What Do We Mean When We Say the Church Is True|find it here]].

## Implications
### Paul Grice's Maxim of Quantity
[Paul Grice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Grice) was a "philosopher of language", and I best know of him for outlining [cooperative principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle). Colloquially called Grice's Maxims, these are accepted as foundational concepts in the linguistic field of pragmatics. One of which is the *Maxim of Quantity*, outlining that in conversation, a participant should:

1. Make your contribution as informative as is required
2. Do not make your contribution more informative than is required

A fellow named Tom Scott has a YouTube channel where he [presents this in an approachable way](https://youtu.be/IJEaMtNN_dM?si=xqRLRGm3UY_cEgd5&t=87), with the example that we don't need to specify that tomatoes are vegan. Giving too much information (these tomatoes do not contain meat nor dairy) is a breach of this maxim of quantity, and so it feels strange and out of place in conversation. Another example is [asbestos-free cereal](https://xkcd.com/641/). You sure hope it has no asbestos, and now you wonder why the manufacturer felt the need to clarify that. The qualification brings more questions than answers; is this an improvement over past shipments that *did* have asbestos?

&nbsp;

### Why testify?
The only reason one would testify "knowing that the church is true" is to negate the idea that it could be wrong, and wrongness would impact its utility or value. It's like saying "there are not lies here." "This is not an attempt to deceive you." Okay...? I didn't consider that possibility until I was assured otherwise.

The implication of verbalizing that "I know [this church] is true" inherently suggests that there are reasons to believe it is not, and you want to remind someone that those reasons are illegitimate. It makes me wonder more about what the disagreement points *are*. As part of the testimony I'm hearing in this hypothetical scenario, I have one side of the argument, but I've also been indirectly advised of the other side. In a way, such a testimony asserts that "it is true, despite the things you or I have heard to say that it is not true."

Per the above outlined maxim of quantity, I am left wondering why did you feel the need to tell me that? Why would Nephi feel the need to tell us that "[the record which [he makes] is true](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng)"? Is he trying to get that idea in edgewise before someone else pops up and says he's lying? Has he been accused of being untruthful in the past? Or, a more cynical explanation is that this statement is in some way a reaction to Lucy Harris' possession of 116 pages of manuscript containing the Book of Lehi's?

This is a childish illustration, but I could tell you that Baskin Robbins ice cream is true. You might ask what in the hell that means, and I could defend my claim by saying that Häagen-Dazs is [the whore of all the earth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10), and they're [trying to convince you](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p26-p27#p26) that Baskin Robbins is led by [[Satan]], and also I promise that I am not trying to deceive you.

It's fucking ice cream. Relax.

### Where else can truth be found?
To qualify "the church" as being "true", implies there must be a *false church*. What's a false church? What if, instead of testifying to the truthfulness of the LDS church, we testified of its legitimacy, veracity, utility, coherence, consistency, or value?

Imagine hearing a description of a friend's church, and they attest to how meaningful it is to them. He or she might describe finding emotional connection in it, comfort or stability in its routines or rituals, teachings, or philosophies. Would you interrupt to ask "but is it *true* though?"

Are Buddha Siddhartha Gautama's teaching "true"? If you were to find a Buddhist adherent, would they describe the philosophy as valuable, useful, meaningful? Or would they assert that "it's true, and that's why I follow it"?

Is truthfulness a precondition for value?
