# ✅ True

> And I know that the record which I make is [true](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng#note3a); and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.

— [1 Nephi 1:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng), Book of Mormon

&nbsp;

> Mormonism is truth; and every man who embraced it felt himself at liberty to embrace every truth: consequently the shackles of superstition, bigotry, ignorance, and priestcraft, falls at once from his neck; and his eyes are opened to see the truth, and truth greatly prevails over priestcraft.

— Joseph Smith; Letter to Isaac Galland, 22 March 1839, p. 53, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed May 26, 2024, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-isaac-galland-22-march-1839/3

> Things that are self-evident or things have been proven are just assumed. If you go to an advanced physics class, They don't testify to the truthfulness of the test physics you learned in the first year. It's it's not only just generally accepted, it is demonstrated over and over again in the advanced material. When you work on computers, the guys don't say "and before I start, I want you to, I want you to know that I know this computer runs on binary". It's just understood, right? 
> 
> So when people are insisting things that otherwise would go without saying, pay attention, when somebody keeps telling you that they're honest, pay attention to it. When  whatever they're repeating to you that normally goes without saying, pay attention to why they feel the need to say that.
> 
> It was a realization for me that the only proof you need for "the church is not true" is that they keep fucking saying it all the time. Because if it was actually true, no one would say it!
>
> People don't say things like "I know the garbage man comes on Wednesdays." They just don't do that. That's not how the human mind works. This is the Smoking Gun. They just keep saying that over and over again, because it was true there would be no need to say it.

## Definition

When we hear the word "true," what does that really mean?
As much distaste as I feel for the trope of introducing a word's definition as part of a thesis (see also LDS sacrament meetings), some cursory searches online define *true* as:

- being in accordance with the actual state of affairs
- in accordance with fact or reality
- without variation from type
- not false
- being what exists, rather than what was thought, intended, or stated

I grew up in the LDS faith, and can't really speak to the experience of other religions. But this does make me wonder, do Catholic church attendees hear a testimony that the Catholic church is true? Or is it assumed? Would the priest be safe to assume that "if you congregants are here listening to me, you already believe it to be true"? Do Jehovah's Witnesses do this?

What does a *true* church even mean?

### Implications
#### Paul Grice's Maxims
[Paul Grice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Grice) was a "philosopher of language", and I best know him for outlining [cooperative principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle). Colloquially called Grice's Maxims, these are accepted as foundational concepts in the linguistic field of pragmatics. One of which is the *Maxim of Quantity*, outlining that in conversation, a participant should:

1. Make your contribution as informative as is required
2. Do not make your contribution more informative than is required

A fellow named Tom Scott has a Youtube channel where he [presents this in a more approachable way](https://youtu.be/IJEaMtNN_dM?si=xqRLRGm3UY_cEgd5&t=87), with the example that we don't need to specify these tomatoes are vegan. Giving too much information (these tomatoes are vegan; they do not contain meat nor dairy) is a breach of this maxim of quantity, and so it feels strange and out of place in conversation. Another example is [asbestos-free cereal](https://xkcd.com/641/). You sure hope it has no asbestos, and now you wonder why the manufacturer felt the need to clarify that. The qualification brings more questions than answers; is this an improvement over past shipments that *did* have asbestos?

The only reason one would testify "knowing that the church is true" is in opposition to the idea that it could be wrong, and wrongness would impact its utility or value. It's like saying "there are not lies here." "This is not an attempt to deceive you." Per the above outlined maxim of quantity, I am left wondering why did you feel the need to tell me that? Why would Nephi feel the need to tell us that "[the record which [he makes] is true](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng)"? Is he trying to get that idea in edgewise before someone else pops up and says he's lying? Has he been accused of being untruthful in the past?

This is a childish illustration, but I could tell you that Baskin Robbins ice cream is true. You might ask what in the hell that means, and I could defend my claim by saying that Häagen-Dazs is [the whore of all the earth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10), and they're [trying to convince you](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p26-p27#p26) that Baskin Robbins is a satanic cult.

It's fucking ice cream. Relax.

To qualify "the church" as being "true", implies there must be a *false church*. What's a false church? What if, instead of testifying to the truthfulness of the LDS church, we testified of its legitimacy, veracity, utility, coherence, consistency, or value?

Imagine hearing a description of a friend's church, and they attest to how meaningful it is to them. He or she might describe finding emotional connection in it, comfort or stability in its routines or rituals, teachings, or philosophies. Would you interrupt to ask "but is it *true* though?"

Are Buddha Siddhartha Gautama's teaching "true"? If you were to find a Buddhist adherent, would they describe the philosophy as valuable, useful, meaningful? Or would they assert that "it's true, and that's why I follow it"?

Is truthfulness a pre-condition for value?
