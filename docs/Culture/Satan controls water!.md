> This revelation was received by the Prophet Joseph Smith on the bank of the Missouri River, McIlwaine’s Bend, on 12 August 1831. The Prophet wrote:

> “On the 9th, in company with ten Elders, I left Independence landing for Kirtland. We started down the river in canoes, and went the first day as far as Fort Osage, where we had an excellent wild turkey for supper. Nothing very important occurred till the third day, when many of the dangers so common upon the western waters, manifested themselves; and after we had encamped upon the bank of the river, at McIlwaine’s Bend, Brother Phelps, in open vision by daylight, ==saw the destroyer in his most horrible power, ride upon the face of the waters==; others heard the noise, but saw not the vision.

> “The next morning after prayer, I received the following: [D&C 61].”

History of the Church, 1:202–3.

  

Right, OK.

That somehow became “Satan controls water”.

Why then, do we:

- Pray to God instead of Satan for rain?
- Get completely immersed in Satan's element for baptism?
- Have bodies made of 70% water?
