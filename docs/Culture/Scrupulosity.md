# ✔️ Scrupulosity
When growing up, inevitably, your authentic self has a question or a doubt or dislikes a teaching. Growing up in the LDS faith, you are taught that it is the devil. That's the voice of Satan. That's *evil*. That is what you are told over and over from a young age, repeatedly throughout your entire life. Whenever you have a thought you're not "supposed" to have, or a question that makes you or others uncomfortable, or your inner voice is disagreeing with a teaching and is yelling and trying to get you to listen, that's Satan. It's like the song *[Turn It Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of5cgecGIhg)* from the *Book of Mormon Musical*.

What does this do to your mind? It turns your authentic self into the enemy. You become your own gaslighter. You try to shove down every thought and feeling you're not supposed to have. It splits your mind into two parts: the "evil" authentic self, and the unquestioning self the church wants you to have.

Eventually, after doing this for years, you lose the ability to hear your inner voice. You lose the ability to know what you really think and feel, and to acknowledge and speak from that voice. This is how the church fucks with your brain.

When you leave, you have to reconstruct yourself from scratch, and it's terrifying because your brain thinks that if you follow your authentic self, you *will* end up doing it wrong. You have believed the whole time you were in the church that your authentic self was dangerous. Your inner voice is wrong. In fact, you probably truly believed there was something seriously wrong with you since no one else spoke up when they had questions— they were too afraid to.

This is the trauma we deal with when leaving the faith. This is why when evangelicals or other groups try to convert ex-mormons, they are simply not interested. We see the same pattern in them and it's triggering. We see the denial of the authentic self that we are being asked to repeat, and we don't want to go back to that. I don't care what the Bible says— if it feels wrong deep in my gut, I'm listening to my gut. I was raised to bury my inner voice, and I'm never going back to burying my inner voice ever again.

How is this manifest in my life today?

Having lost faith about five years before the time of writing this, I’m still learning to trust myself. So often I look for external approval or advice, and avoid making bigger decisions for myself.
