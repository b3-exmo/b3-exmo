# 🤓 Name "Mormon"
At the end of the day, one growing problem that the LDS church is facing is that continuous revelation has to fit with existing revelation. This is compounded by the idea that religious leaders are obligated to say something inspiring twice a year in Conference, and sometimes each month in the LDS churchs’ official magazine publication, Ensign. This gets further compounded by the idea that we have no fewer than fifteen people we sustain as prophets, seers and revelators at any given time. They are going to encounter logic problems and conflicting information, because they have to continue dispensing information to prove legitimacy. They will inevitably do or say something that contradicts past teachings that were presented as immutable and inerrant, and then [have to justify it](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie?lang=eng&id=p9#p9).

## Are nicknames acceptable?
### 1990

> > “Thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” ([D&C 115:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.4?lang=eng#p4).)
>
> Note carefully the language of the Lord. He did not say, “Thus shall my church be _named._” He said, “Thus shall my church be _called._” Years ago, its members were cautioned by the Brethren who wrote: “We feel that some may be misled by the ==too frequent use of the term ‘Mormon Church.’==” Before any other name is considered to be a legitimate substitute, the thoughtful person might reverently consider the feelings of the Heavenly Parent who bestowed that name.

— [*“Thus Shall My Church Be Called”*](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1990/04/thus-shall-my-church-be-called?lang=eng), Elder Russel M Nelson, General Conference April 1990

I'd paraphrase the talk as saying “we should be more specific and deliberate about the names we use to refer to our faith.”

I'll also observe that the document cited by Nelson describing "too frequent use of the term 'Mormon Church'" hasn't come up during my online searches. Maybe I didn't try hard enough, but... I would like to see the document and who it attributes those words do. Nelson was [called as an apostle in '84](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/russell-m-nelson?lang=eng), precluding the possibility of Nelson quoting himself.

&nbsp;

> Many of our people are disturbed by the practice of the media, and of many others, to disregard totally the true name of the Church and to use the nickname “the Mormon Church.”
> 
> ...
> 
> I suppose that ==regardless of our efforts, we may never convert the world to general use of the full and correct name of the Church. Because of the shortness of the word Mormon and the ease with which it is spoken and written, they will continue to call us the Mormons==, the Mormon church, and so forth.
> 
> ==They could do worse==. More than fifty years ago, when I was a missionary in England, I said to one of my associates, “How can we get people, including our own members, to speak of the Church by its proper name?”
> 
> He replied, “You can’t. ==The word Mormon is too deeply ingrained and too easy to say==.” He went on, “I’ve quit trying. While I’m thankful for the privilege of being a follower of Jesus Christ and a member of the Church which bears His name, ==I am not ashamed of the nickname Mormon==.”
> 
> “Look,” he went on to say, “if there is any name that is totally honorable in its derivation, it is the name Mormon. And so, when someone asks me about it and what it means, I quietly say— ==‘Mormon means more good.’==”

— [_Mormon_ Should Mean “More Good”](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1990/10/mormon-should-mean-more-good?lang=eng&id=p15-p18#p15), Gordon B Hinckley, General Conference October 1990

I'd paraphrase the above quote as “we can’t stop people from calling us Mormons. Might as well lean into it… besides, they could be calling us worse things!”

Meaning "more good" is cited as a quote from Joseph Smith himself ([1](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-editor-circa-20-may-1843/1?highlight=more+good), [2](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-d-1-1-august-1842-1-july-1843/198?highlight=more+good)), and oh boy is that a baffling display of etymology.

The matter faded out of official leadership discourse for 28 years, until...

&nbsp;

### 2018

> Taking the Savior’s name upon us includes declaring and witnessing to others—through our actions and our words—that Jesus is the Christ. ==Have we been so afraid to offend someone who called us “Mormons” that we have failed to defend the Savior Himself==, to stand up for Him even in the name by which His Church is called?

— [The Correct Name of the Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/the-correct-name-of-the-church?lang=eng), President Russel M Nelson, General Conference October 2018

Nelson. My guy. My main man. Calm down.

&nbsp;

> If someone should ask, “Are you a Mormon?” you could reply, “If you are asking if I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, yes, I am!”

Thus incites the insufferable corrections from pedantic missionaries the world over.

I am not a mathematician. [Someone who is good with numbers](3600-for-candles.jpg), please help me determine which term's count of syllables is fewer:

|   mor-mon   | a mem-ber of the church of je-sus christ of lat-ter day saints |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 2 syllables |                          15 syllables                          |

If you, dear reader, have had an interaction like the above quote from Nelson correcting someone when you both know goddamned well what the word means, tell me: has the correction been received graciously?

&nbsp;

Here's a [side-by-side video comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lKQrYUE3yc) of Hinckley vs Nelson's arguments on the matter.

### Offended
> “However, it ultimately is impossible for another person to offend you or to offend me. Indeed, believing that another person offended us is fundamentally false. ==To be offended is a choice we make==; it is not a condition inflicted or imposed upon us by someone or something else.”

— [And Nothing Shall Offend Them](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them?lang=eng&id=p15#p15), Elder David A Bednar, General Conference October 2006

&nbsp;

> “He who takes offense when no offense was intended is a fool, and he who takes offense when offense was intended is usually a fool.”

— Brigham Young; quote taken from [Forgiveness: The Ultimate Form of Love](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1974/01/forgiveness-the-ultimate-form-of-love?lang=eng&id=p28#p28), an Ensign address in Jan 1974

&nbsp;

These men were both sustained as a spokesperson for God, right?

Right?

Oh, were they speaking as a man? My bad.

&nbsp;

#### What offends God?
God wasn’t offended when Brigham Young had slavery legalized in Utah, or when he said Christ’s atonement wasn’t good enough and people needed to have their throats slit to cover the more egregious sins. God doesn’t seem offended by those who kill in his name. He isn’t offended by church leaders sexually abusing children, hoarding wealth, short-selling stocks, misrepresenting His teachings, but *don’t you dare say “Mormon”*!

We have a living prophet today, who speaks in behalf of God. Turns out, when we have a land war in Europe, racial injustice and political upheaval, uncertainty pertaining to a viral disease, the only thing God really wants is for us to not call church members Mormons anymore.

Ok. Sure thing, buddy.

&nbsp;

## A name given by enemies

> [T]he name Mormon, and Mormonism, was ==given to us by our enemies==, but Latter Day Saints was the real name by which the church was organized.

— Joseph Smith, Letter to Isaac Galland, 22 March 1839, p. 54, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed May 26, 2024, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-isaac-galland-22-march-1839/4#10621821545696261506

"enemies" has a footnote; let's expand that.

> As early as June 1830, an outside observer noted that because JS’s followers “believe in the Book of Mormon, they bear the name Mormonites.” In the 1830s, journalists called the religion “Mormonism,” with church members referred to as “Mormonites” and “Mormons.”

🤔 Would I be wrong to conclude that this comment of the prophet Joseph Smith's words equates 'outside observers' and journalists as *enemies*? Historically, those who think of journalists as enemies have been trying to conceal something nefarious.

We can't really read tone through text. Is Smith's comment resentful of the name Mormon to refer to religious adherents? Or is he indifferent and willing to just roll with it?

For what it's worth, the footnote does have numerous citations and sources for the claim; at the time of writing this document, I haven't examined the sources.

&nbsp;

## “I’m a Mormon” campaign
Honestly. Unironically. Demonstrate to me that calling someone “Mormon” was offensive between the Brighamite sect break-off and 2018. Did any of the "Mormon pioneers" get in a huff and correct Omaha residents by asserting "we're actually 'a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints' pioneers"?

If you can demonstrate that "Mormon" was a mean-spirited derogatory slur at some point in time, I will demonstrate a multi-million dollar marketing campaign going in the opposite direction, leaning into the nickname and actively promoting that LDS members should be called Mormons. This campaign included ads in those huge screens on Times Square.

The *I’m a Mormon* campaign was really the centerpiece of my mission. Those were THE pass-along cards I was given to distribute. I had DVDs to hand out of that feature-length documentary. I would bring investigators to the visitor’s center with the explicit intent and purpose of showing them the cool rooms fashioned around the campaign, to show them videos of that campaign. It worked.

Under Monson, it was fine.

Under Nelson, it is “a victory for Satan.”

🙄

## Name changes
The name of the modern LDS Church has undergone [numerous name changes](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/topic/church-of-christ). Most notably is the second name.

**1830: [Church of Christ](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-6-april-1830-dc-21/1) is founded**
Reading through that recorded revelation has "church of Christ" appear once mid-sentence. 19th century grammar may just be throwing me off.

> ... ye are an Elder under [Oliver Cowdery's ordination] unto you that thou mightest be an Elder ==unto this Church of Christ== bearing my name & the first Preacher of this Church unto the Church & before the world...

Maybe I'm just being contrarian, but that doesn't sound to me like an authoritative declaration of naming an organization. Oh well.

&nbsp;

**1834: Church of Latter Day Saints** [1](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/483),[2](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minutes-3-may-1834/1)
Four years after the church is formally founded, Joseph Smith himself recorded some minutes of a meeting where they decide to change the name from the *Church of Christ* to the *Church of Latter Day Saints*.

> After Prayer the conference proceeded to discuss the subject of names and appellations, when a motion was made by Sidney Rigdon, and seconded by Newel K. Whitney, that this church be known hereafter by the name of ==the church of the Latter Day Saints==. Remarks were made by the members after which ==the motion passed by unanimous voice==.

If God is offended when Christ’s name ~~gets taken out of the church~~ is omitted for conversational brevity, how do we come to terms with Joseph Smith himself literally taking Christ’s name out of the church? This is not a rhetorical question, I really do want an answer to this one.

&nbsp;

**1838: the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-march-september-1838/18)**

> [Verily] thus Saith the Lord unto you ... my faithful Servants, who are of the High Council of my ==Church in zion== (for thus it shall be called) and unto all the Elders and people of my ==Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints==...
>
> ... for thus shall my Church be called in the Last days even ==the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints==.

Eight years after being established, its proper name is revealed. Now it’s the name we’re familiar with.

"church in Zion" also sounds like it's being presented (by revelation, no less) as the name of the religious organization headed by Joseph Smith, but I guess that's not the point we should focus on.

I guess iterating this formally in [D&C 115](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115?lang=eng&id=4#p4) ought to settle it.

&nbsp;

I could imagine someone arguing that the 1830 & 1838 names were by revelation, and the 1834 (no Christ version) name was by counsel with feeble, imperfect, mortal humans prone to errors. Disregarding that every fucking one of them are called and ordained of God, and I suppose not one of them thought to pray about it ahead of time? Was the 1834 gathering not led by God? Did the opening prayer focus on blessing the donuts rather than being led by thy spirit?

&nbsp;

### Style Guide
I did some sleuthing to locate if the modern LDS church is fussy about the hyphen between the words *latter* and *day*, but didn't find anything strongly worded about it. Some style guides ([1](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/style-guide), [2](https://uc.byuh.edu/church-style-guide-6th-edition-2020)) do specify that the term should be hyphenated, but don't put a lot of weight on the idea. Closest I found was a guide for [use within Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Latter_Day_Saints#Basic_gloss), but I don't think I'd call that definitive.

Although, one thing I stumbled upon seems to have aged poorly:

> - When referring to Church members, the term "Latter-day Saints" is preferred, though "Mormons" is acceptable.
>  
> - The term "Mormonism" is acceptable in describing the combination of doctrine, culture and lifestyle unique to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

## Vain Repetition
### Melchizedek Priesthood

> _Why is the higher priesthood named after someone called Melchizedek? Wouldn’t it make more sense to name it after the Lord? The early Saints wondered about this, and the Lord explained it through the Prophet Joseph Smith:_

> _“Before his [Melchizedek’s] day it was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God._

> _“But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, ==to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name==, they, the church, in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek” (_[_Doctrine and Covenants 107:3–4_](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&verse=2-4&id=html#p2)_)._

— [Why is the priesthood named after Melchizedek?](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/why-is-the-priesthood-named-after-melchizedek?lang=eng), lds.org

“God” isn’t even his name, though?

&nbsp;

God: Don’t call it *the holy priesthood after the Order of the Son of God*. That uses Jesus’  name & title too much. Nickname it after Melchizedek, a righteous guy.

Also God: Don’t nickname my church after a righteous guy, Mormon. That doesn’t use Jesus’ full name enough.

&nbsp;

### Jehovah in the Old Testament

> Why then is Jehovah missing from our Bible translations? The answer can be found in the way His name has been treated by Jews since the days of Malachi and Zechariah. Jehovah is the name of God, and devout Jews, out of reverence for Him, never say His name. Instead they substitute Adonai, a Hebrew title meaning “Lord.” So whenever they speak of Him or read aloud His name from scripture, they substitute Adonai (Lord).

— [LORD = Jehovah](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2002/06/lord-equals-jehovah?lang=eng), Ensign, June 2002

I suppose we could argue that LDS faith is not Jewish, and has little connection there. But... why not? If we revere the Bible as much as we say we do, why don’t we observe this tradition?
