# 🥓 Curated Information
I don't really know what to title this page. The intent is "don't look outside of our ecosystem for information." Does that make internal information curated? Not necessarily, but it was an excuse to use that bacon emoji, which is always a win in my book. Get it? Curated sources, cured bacon... yeah, I guess it was funnier in my head

&nbsp;

> *In today’s world, information is easy to access and share. This can be a great blessing for those seeking to be educated and informed. ==However, many sources of information are unreliable== and do not edify. Some sources seek to promote anger, contention, fear, or baseless conspiracy theories (see [3 Nephi 11:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p30#p30); [Mosiah 2:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)). Therefore, it is important that Church members be wise as they seek truth.*
> 
> *Members of the Church should seek out and share only credible, reliable, and factual sources of information. They should avoid sources that are speculative or founded on rumor. The guidance of the Holy Ghost, along with careful study, can help members discern between truth and error (see [Doctrine and Covenants 11:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11?lang=eng&id=p12#p12); [45:57](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p57#p57)). In matters of doctrine and Church policy, the ==authoritative sources are the scriptures, the teachings of the living prophets, and the General Handbook==.*

Yeah. Many sources of information are unreliable. I don't want anyone to consider that the LDS church has always been a reliable source, though. It's been known to obscure information.

## Truly educated
> *With the abundance of books available today, ==it is a mark of a truly educated man to know what not to read==.*

— *[In His Steps](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1988/09/in-his-steps?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)*, President Ezra Taft Benson, First Presidency Message, Ensign 1988 September

There's a link to the source. Hop in and tell me if there's some context I'm missing, because it sure looks to me like he's redefining "education," conflating it to mean  "obedient to church leadership."

&nbsp;

Truth be told, I encountered this not because I was flipping through a printed Ensign from '88, but it was quoted in a BYU devotional speech. Here's the quote that led me here:

> *As we humbly search the scriptures, we will come to know both Jesus Christ and his servant, Joseph Smith. In this connection, may I offer a suggestion to all of us? If we truly desire to know the Prophet, we must go to the right source—and that is not a Google search. As President Ezra Taft Benson taught, “Today, with the abundance of books available, it is the mark of a truly educated man to ==know what not to read==.” The Lord gave us the key to knowing Joseph Smith when he said, “seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom.” ==And what are the best books? They are the scriptures==. The Savior taught that we “shall know them by their fruits.” We will come to know the Prophet by daily partaking of his fruit—the scriptures—more than any other writings.*

— *[Millions Shall Know Brother Joseph Again](https://www.byui.edu/speeches/jayson-kunzler/millions-shall-know-brother-joseph-again)*, Jayson Kunzler, BYU Devotionals, 20 October 2015

Hey, uh... Mr Kunzler? I... I can't think of a more polite way to remind you of this, but you're speaking at an accredited university, telling people that education means just reading scriptures, not researching independently. If I had heard this being proliferated at Virginia Tech, UCLA, or Berkley, I would lose respect for those institutions. BYU is a university, and students are being told to not read.

"abandon all ~~hope~~ `critical thinking`, ye who enter here"

&nbsp;

While we're in proximity to this devotional and quote, I'll advise readers to follow the cited link and read (or listen) for yourselves. An opening remark is Bruce McConkie panicking that missionaries in the '80's didn't rank Joseph Smith as being comparably important as God. Go check for yourself. *No, we're not a cult.*

&nbsp;

An educated person can read things and determine whether or not it's bullshit. I will argue that knowing how to interpret information is one "mark of a truly educated man." Knowing what is credible, what to rely on, what to take at face value. This sounds to me like Benson, president of the church, was suggesting that an educated person should *only read scriptures*. ... But not the Bible, since that's conveniently not "[translated correctly](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?id=p8&lang=eng#p8)" whenever we decide that it is. So just the Book of Mormon, D&C, and Pearl of Great Price. Except for the [[Book of Abraham]], which might not have anything to do with Abraham. Doctrine & Covenants... eh, maybe. Not [[DC 132|section 132]], for sure. You know what, just read the [[Book of Mormon]]. Just that one. That's what will make you educated. Reading only one book with its myriad [[logistical-problems#Anachronisms|anachronisms]] and lack of historical quality is all you need. That will make you smarter than all those dorks with their "degrees" and "certificates."

For what it's worth, one demonstration of untrustworthy information today is AI-generated texts, or summaries of searches. Those are a fairly recent breakthrough, and they aren't always reliable. How much education do you need to understand that when [Google tells you that eating rocks](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-s-ai-tells-users-to-add-glue-to-their-pizza-eat-rocks-and-make-chlorine-gas/ar-BB1n0rB1) is good for your health, that's not reliable information? What I'm hearing instead is that an educated person simply never reads anything that isn't a religious text. I can get behind Kunzler's admonition to not take Google's top results as objective truth. However, I also wish to point out that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) from the LDS church ensures that their curated pages are at the top of online searches. SEO isn't something to really delve into as a side note, but suffice it to say that SEO is both arranging and organizing one's webpage for webcrawlers, and the other part of SEO is "paying Google lots of money to put these results before others." After all, you can buy anything in this world with money.

&nbsp;

Maybe I'm being too harsh, and the intended context is seeking information about a church leader instead of education on a broader perspective. I could imagine that being a fair defense.

I'm willing to concede that I'm just some grump, but Alma's [war chapters](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?id=p5-p6&lang=eng#p5), Ether's [barges](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?id=p16-p17&lang=eng#p16) and [[logistical-problems#How many people died?|holocaust-scale deaths]], [Teancum throwing a javelin](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62?id=p36&lang=eng#p36) through enemy military leaders, nor [Nephite women being violated](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?id=p9-p10&lang=eng#p9) are going to help me understand one Russel Marion Nelson better. Actually, if those tales *did* help me understand Nelson better, I think that connection would warrant further examination and scrutiny. I'll be real, not all parts of the *Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ*, turn my thoughts toward Jesus Christ. Similarly, they won't all remind me of Jesus' mortal representative in Salt Lake City.

&nbsp;

## Be like the prophet
> *Russell M. Nelson is obedient to the president of the Church, and he is ==baffled when he hears people ask questions like, “Is it really the will of the Lord that we do everything that President Kimball says?”==*
> 
> *“The Lord said, ‘Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same,’” Dr. Nelson reminds us. “My experience is that once you stop putting question marks behind the prophet’s statements and put exclamation points instead, and do it, the blessings just pour.*
> 
> *“==I never ask myself, ‘When does the prophet speak as a prophet and when does he not?==’ My interest has been, ‘How can I be more like him?”*

— *[Russell M. Nelson: A Study in Obedience](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/1983/01/russell-m-nelson-a-study-in-obedience?lang=eng&id=p40-p42#p40)*, Lane Johnson, Liahona 1983 January

A more recent iteration of this was quoted in *[The Prophet of God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/the-prophet-of-god?lang=eng&id=p30#p30)*, Elder Neil L. Andersen, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, General Conference 2018 April; having that passage here was redundant, as it's practically a direct quote of the above.

&nbsp;

Where to start?

"I'm not worried if what he's saying is reliable or accurate. I just want to 'be more like him' because of the warm fuzzy feelings in my tummy. No critical evaluation needed! What? No, we're not a cult."

If you blindly obey what the acting president of the church says, "blessings just pour." What blessings? Also, *what [[What are blessings|are blessings]]*? Blessings aren't quantifiable in the first place, and hearing that they "just pour" isn't really assuring either. How can anyone demonstrate that obedience leads to vague improvements?

&nbsp;

## OBEY ME
> *Declared President Joseph F. Smith in October 1873, “Obedience is the first law of heaven.”*

... It is also the first law of North Korea. I don't think that's a selling point. In fact, in the Mormon belief of the pre-mortal war in heaven, Satan got kicked out for his plan where obedience was the first law. But when a prophet declares that here on earth, it's fine.

Why would God endow us with free will and capacity for critical thinking if He simply wanted us to abandon it and simply obey leadership? What the hell, God? If Joseph Smith Jr. was blindly obedient, we would not have the restored gospel today.

Fortunately for us, this quote from 1873 was just a one-off remark that definitely didn't get used to establish credibility in later years. Nope, later church leaders never [used this](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?facet=all&lang=eng&query=%22obedience+is+the+first+law+of+heaven%22&page=1) to justify preaching obedience. Well... I dunno, maybe just once or twice.

You guys say you represent Jesus, right? Right.

## doubt ur doubts
> *My dear friends—please, first ==doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith==. We must never allow doubt to hold us prisoner and keep us from the divine love, peace, and gifts that come through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.*

— *[Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Come, Join with Us,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2013/11/saturday-morning-session/come-join-with-us?lang=eng&id=p48#p48)*

I've mentioned this [[Doubts and Truth#Doubt Your Doubts|on another page]], but what I find disagreeable here is it actively encourages [[Cognitive Bias]]— if you heard something good about LDS teachings before you heard something bad, just disregard the bad information. You already know the "correct" answer. This means that if you were raised in the church like I was, just doubt anything negative you encounter. It'll be fine.
