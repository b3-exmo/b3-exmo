# 🤐 Strengthening Church Members Committee
## Deseret News
> *A former Utah Supreme Court justice and ==the church's expert on disciplinary procedures, Elder Oaks== said the disciplinary decisions ranging from probation to excommunication are meted out by bishops and stake presidents.*
>
> *He explained that local leaders are informed by church headquarters about members who may possibly be violating church standards. The church's ==Strengthening the Members Committee== pores over newspapers and other publications and identifies members accused of crimes, preaching false doctrine, ==criticizing leadership== or other problems. That information is forwarded on to the person's bishop or stake president, who is charged with helping them overcome problems and stay active in the church.*
>
> *"It is a way of keeping busy bishops informed," he said. "But it is up to the bishop to handle it. Bishops don't report back."*
>
> *Michael Quinn, a historian living in Salt Lake City, who said he was excommunicated this week, said that may be the procedure. "==But when a local leader is handed information from general authorities, it carries enormous weight and is the equivalent of instruction==," he said.*

> *Generally, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not respond to criticism levied against its work. But in light of extensive publicity recently given to false accusations of so-called secret Church committees and files, the First Presidency has issued the following statement:*
> 
> *"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was established in 1830 following the appearance of God the Father and Jesus Christ to the Prophet Joseph Smith in upstate New York. This sacred event heralded the onset of the promised restitution of all things.' Many instructions were subsequently given to the Prophet including Section 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "And again, we would suggest for your consideration the propriety of all the saints gathering up a knowledge of all the facts, and sufferings and abuses put upon them. . . .*
> 
> *" And also of all the property and amount of damages which they have sustained, both of character and personal injuries. . . .*
> 
> *" And also the names of all persons that have had a hand in their oppressions, as far as they can get hold of them and find them out.*
> 
> *" And perhaps a committee can be appointed to find out these things, and to take statements and affidavits; and also to gather up the libelous publications that are afloat;*
> 
> *" And all that are in the magazines, and in the encyclopedias, and all the libelous histories that are published. . . . (Verses 1-5.)'*
> 
> *"Leaders and members of the Church strive to implement commandments of the Lord including this direction received in 1839. Because the Church has a non-professional clergy, its stake presidents and bishops have varied backgrounds and training. In order to assist their members who have questions, these local leaders often request information from General Authorities of the Church.*
> 
> *"The Strengthening Church Members Committee was appointed by the First Presidency to help fulfill this need and to comply with the cited section of the Doctrine and Covenants. This committee serves as a resource to priesthood leaders throughout the world who may desire assistance on a wide variety of topics. It is a General Authority committee, currently comprised of Elder James E. Faust and Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They work through established priesthood channels, and neither impose nor direct Church disciplinary action.*
> 
> *"Members who have questions concerning Church doctrine, policies, or procedures have been counseled to discuss those concerns confidentially with their local leaders. These leaders are deeply aware of their obligation to counsel members wisely in the spirit of love, in order to strengthen their faith in the Lord and in His great latter-day work."*

> *The First Presidency*

Whelp... I guess I'll wait for a phone call from my bishop. These notes are publicly available on that world-wide web, so I've almost certainly got my own file in the SCMC's cabinets. Smile and wave in the comment section!
