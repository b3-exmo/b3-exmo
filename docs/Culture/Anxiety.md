# 😬 Anxiety

"Why are all these kids struggling with anxiety today?" — A nonspecific church authority, probably

>In this course, you will learn how to be a good steward of the things you have been blessed with. This lesson is all about using time. God has given you agency to use your time as you choose, but he warns us not to “idle away thy time” ([D&C 60:13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60.13?lang=eng)) because you will have to stand before God one day and give an account of what you did with your time. You will have to provide a stewardship of the time, talents, and blessings that the Lord has given you.

>The principle of accountability is fundamental in God’s eternal plan. We will all stand before the Lord at the last judgment and give an accounting for what we have done with the opportunities He has given us (see [Alma 5:15–19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.15-19?lang=eng#p15); [Doctrine and Covenants 137:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.9?lang=eng#p9)).

_"God has given you agency to use your time as you choose,"_ But slow down, now, buddy— _"he warns [you] not to waste it."_

So do I have agency or not? What kind of agency is this where, if I use it as I please I end up doomed? Is it just a label? "You have agency, but use it _only_ in this way, otherwise, to hell with you!"

- "You are free to choose. But choose _this way_ or you'll die."
- "Tithing is voluntary. But if you don't pay you aren't saved."
- "Yes! She _chose_ to be baptized!"

Every decision we make has consequences— no qualm or disagreement there. But an earthly organization attaching eternal damnation to my life's decisions does not sit well with me.

Pervasive cultural ideas I've encountered:

- Not doing enough: Scripture study, prayer, temple work, ministering, missionary work, etc.
- Not worthy enough: to give blessings with the priesthood or have the holy ghost as your companion. Or not worthy of other blessings in life or in the next life. Not living up to my patriarchal blessing.
- Not understanding or performing the gospel correctly. "I shouldn't just go through the motions, I need to have faith in the saving ordinances!"

Yeah I'm living in a state of constant worry that I'm being watched and judged by an invisible, vengeful deity. I'm always second-guessing every decision I make, and even today, I'm grappling with the idea of activities being "permissible" or not.
