# üó£Ô∏è In General Conference
### 1994
> Some people say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford to pay tithing.‚Äù ==Those who place their faith in the Lord‚Äôs promises say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford not to pay tithing.‚Äù==
> 
> Some time ago I was speaking to a meeting of Church leaders in a country outside of North America. As I spoke about tithing, I found myself saying something I had not intended to say. I told them the Lord was grieved that only a small fraction of the members in their nations relied on the Lord‚Äôs promises and paid a full tithing. ==I warned that the Lord would withhold material and spiritual blessings when his covenant children were not keeping this vital commandment==.
> 
> I hope those leaders taught that principle to the members of the stakes and districts in their countries. The law of tithing and the promise of blessings to those who live it apply to the people of the Lord in every nation. I hope our members will qualify for the blessings of the Lord by paying a full tithing.

I know this isn't the point, but... A country outside of North America? That narrows it down to, what, 190 possibilities?

Perhaps these words would carry more weight if they weren't spoken by someone whose livelihood depends on tithing income.

### 2002
>All tithing funds are spent for the purposes of the Church, including welfare‚Äîcare for the poor and needy‚Äîtemples, buildings and upkeep of meetinghouses, education, curriculum‚Äîin short, the work of the Lord.

### 2004
> May I suggest five key steps to financial freedom for your consideration.
> 
> **_First, pay your tithing._** ==Do you want the windows of heaven opened to you?== Do you wish to receive blessings so great there is not room enough to receive them? Always pay your tithing and leave the outcome in the hands of the Lord.
> 
> Obedience to God‚Äôs commandments is the foundation for a happy life. Surely we will be blessed with the gifts of heaven for our obedience. ==Failure to pay tithing by those who know the principle== can lead to heartache in this life and perhaps sorrow in the next.

### 2007
> Last week in the Young Women meeting, President Hinckley said, ==‚ÄúWhile tithing is paid with money, more importantly it is paid with faith.‚Äù==
> 
> Another time he said: ‚ÄúThis is not so much a matter of money as it is a matter of faith. ‚Ä¶ I urge you, ‚Ä¶ every one of you, to take the Lord at His word in this important matter.‚Äù
> 
> It is a matter of commitment. The earth belongs to the Lord, and this includes our own lives. He allows us to use _everything_ on this earth. He only asks us to return one-tenth. Tithing is a token of gratitude, obedience, and thanksgiving‚Äîa token of our willingness and dedication. Paying tithing, willingly, develops an honest and pure heart. Paying tithing increases our love for the Lord.
> 
> The Lord said, ‚ÄúIt is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people.‚Äù

And you show that gratitude to God by paying *me*. üò§

### 2012
>If paying tithing means that you can‚Äôt pay for water or electricity, ==pay tithing==. If paying tithing means that you can‚Äôt pay your rent, ==pay tithing==. Even if paying tithing means that you don‚Äôt have enough money to feed your family, ==pay tithing==. The Lord will not abandon you.

>After paying tithing for some time, Evelyn and Amado spoke with Bishop Orellana about the blessings they had received. Referring to ==Malachi 3:10==, they said, ‚ÄúWe have proven the Lord.‚Äù And true to Bishop Orellana‚Äôs promise, the Lord never abandoned them.

### 2017
Yet somehow, even though it wasn‚Äôt strictly a commandment in any of the three previous examples, we hear _heartwarming_ stories like this:

> _One day during those difficult times, I heard my parents discussing whether they should pay tithing or buy food for the children. On Sunday, I followed my father to see what he was going to do. After our Church meetings, I saw him take an envelope and put his tithing in it. That was only part of the lesson. The question that remained for me was what we were going to eat._

[The Language of the Gospel](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel?lang=eng&id=p21-p22#p21), Elder Valeri¬†V. Cord√≥n of the Seventy, General Conference April 2017

Tell me how to make sense of this. _It feels dishonest_. It feels manipulative. This passage explicitly states that members should put the organization first, pay money before handling your own biological needs. Yet proponents of the church will still be baffled as to why outsiders see the LDS church as a cult.

&nbsp;

### 2023
>_The Apostle Paul warned that the wisdom of men understands the things of men but has difficulty understanding the things of God. ==The world speaks of tithing in terms of our money, but the sacred law of tithing is principally a matter of our faith.== Being honest in our tithes is one way we show our willingness to put the Lord first in our lives, above our own cares and interest. I promise you that as you trust in the Lord, the [[What are blessings|blessings of heaven]] will follow._
>
>. . .
>
>*The Lord clearly directed how tithing should be disbursed, saying, ‚ÄúBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,‚Äù meaning bring the tithes into His restored kingdom, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He directed that the use of these sacred tithes would be prayerfully considered by a council of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Presiding Bishopric, ‚Äúand by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord.‚Äù*

[Tithing: Opening the Windows of Heaven](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng&id=p40-p18#p40), Elder Neil¬†L. Andersen, General Conference October 2023

Blessings of heaven, you say? That sounds so incredibly vague. I'm being asked to pay an organization a portion of my money, which money is quantifiable, tangible, useful, in exchange for... Something. Maybe it'll be just health. Maybe you didn't get in a car collision. [[Falsifiability|You'll never really know]].

&nbsp;

Something I haven't done is analyze the urgency or frequency at which the idea of tithing is presented in general conference, or other teaching material- I'm interested to know if the attitude shifts at all around 1997, when Ensign Peak Advisors is established.
