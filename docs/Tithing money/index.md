# üíµTithing Money
[[Audits]]

[[In General Conference]]

Quick note: I would like to be proven wrong about the ideas in this page. To me, this is disheartening, and to you, it may sound very pessimistic. If you have compelling information that disproves any of this, there's a comment section at the bottom of each page.

&nbsp;

Tithing is required to get into the temple, right? And temple ceremonies are required for salvation? That means that tithing is required for salvation.

- A religion that requires payments for full access isn‚Äôt a religion.
- If tithing is required, it isn‚Äôt voluntary.
- A church that promises a happy afterlife in exchange for money is indistinguishable from fraud.
- If your god needs your money, your god is incompetent.
- ‚ÄúGod doesn‚Äôt need the money‚Äù Then what the hell am I paying for? Salvation is kept behind a paywall.
- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so we can get blessed‚Äù There‚Äôs no other way to qualify for those blessings, than donating money to an organization with 0 accountability?
- ‚ÄúWe need tithing to do the Lord‚Äôs work.‚Äù Idk has the church tried praying for money? Has the church asked its family and friends for money instead?
- If the church is great with our money, why don‚Äôt they publish their budgets? Why don‚Äôt they prove that they are good stewards of our donations? Why, instead, did they set up 13 shell companies?

Please, list the ordinances I qualify for without paying any money. ‚ÄúTithing is a commandment‚Äù is not a reason.
## [[My own experience#Connecting the dots|As I See It]]
In college, while I was taking accounting classes, I encountered a MormonLeaks whistleblower report that the LDS church had an outrageous sum of money, not being disbursed. Trying to apply what I‚Äôve learned from accounting, I resolved that the church surely has balance sheets and reports. They _could_ set the record straight about how much money they have, and where it‚Äôs going.

In General Conference, I‚Äôd listen to their [[#Internal Audits|financial audit report]]. I was not impressed. ‚ÄúWe have examined ourselves, and found us to be following our own rules.‚Äù What rules? Why not have an external audit? Can we get more detail than a pass/fail?

If they do have accounts and reports, they are not publicly available. It sounds like a deliberate choice to conceal that information. I‚Äôm asked to send money to an organization with absolutely no accountability for how it‚Äôs used. I decided to not pay a dime more until I see some satisfying data on how the money gets used. That is tangible, quantitative information that can be reported, no faith needed. The number is there, but it is hidden from me.
## Many billions
Somewhere between 30 and 100 billion in investment portfolios:

- Washington Post: [Mormon Church has misled members on $100 billion tax-exempt investment fund, whistleblower alleges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/mormon-church-has-misled-members-on-100-billion-tax-exempt-investment-fund-whistleblower-alleges/2019/12/16/e3619bd2-2004-11ea-86f3-3b5019d451db_story.html)
- Wall Street Journal: [The Mormon Church Amassed $100 Billion. It Was the Best-Kept Secret in the Investment World.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mormon-church-amassed-100-billion-it-was-the-best-kept-secret-in-the-investment-world-11581138011)

Side note: both of these sources have a draconian paywall‚Äî these links may not work. I've saved  offline copies, but I'm leery of the copyright implications of putting them here. Maybe a non-specific search engine could help you get around it? Maybe a cached version from webcrawlers? Maybe a browser's "reading mode" that disables javascript? Just some ideas.

Internal audits promise that everything is fine, and "in accordance with appropriate accounting practices, approved budgets, and Church policies and procedures." This isn't necessarily a lie- the church most certainly has budgets, policies, procedures, etc, and perhaps amassing $100 billion doesn't breach any of those rules. That does raise the question of *what exactly are those rules, then?* Can any readers point me to them? I've got a comment section for exactly that purpose.

**No, the church doesn't have a legal obligation to publish any of this**. But, if they want to garner trust that the money is spent on things like charity, or helping "the needy", they certainly could be sharing that information. An external audit would reveal this information, but the church (to my knowledge) doesn't arrange any.
## Malachi
Quote often used by the church:

> _‚ÄúProve me now herewith .¬†.¬†. if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.‚Äù_

Chapter divisions weren‚Äôt present in the original revisions of the King James Version. The book of Malachi was one big ol' wall of text. The book of Malachi is a criticism of the temple priest class in ancient Judaism. Chapter 2 verse 1 says [‚ÄúAnd now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.‚Äù](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)

[Chapter 3 verses 8 - 11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p8-p11#p8) are not directed to the general public to contribute to God‚Äôs storehouse. They‚Äôre reprimanding the priests for misusing the tithing funds to live lavishly. Malachi is saying that this misuse of tithing is why, as 3:9 says, ‚Äú[ye are cursed.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)‚Äù

Chapter 3 verse 3 is a threat to ‚Äú[the sons of Levi](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)‚Äù. What we today call the Aaronic Priesthood was only found in those of Levitical bloodline and lineage.

This is not an admonition for the general public, us common folk in [current year] reading the Old Testament. _He is talking to the priests of the temple_.
### Quoted pretty often
I'm not going for a comprehensive list of how often this passage is mentioned when talking about tithing. You don't want to read that, and I don't want to write it.

That said, here are some references I found from a cursory search:

- [Sacred Transformations](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2012/12/sacred-transformations?lang=eng&id=p17#p17), Aaron L West, Ensign December 2012 (excerpts shown below)

I've got a separate page for some [[In General Conference|General Conference]] segments and quotes of interest, including some of the above mentions.
## Lorenzo Snow
>_I plead with you in the name of the Lord, and I pray that every man, woman and child ‚Ä¶ shall pay one-tenth of their income as a tithing._

‚Äî _[Chapter 12: Tithing, a Law for Our Protection and Advancement](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-lorenzo-snow/chapter-12-tithing-a-law-for-our-protection-and-advancement?lang=eng&id=title4-p12#title4)_, Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Lorenzo Snow

![[tithing1.png]]

That ellipsis and that footnote are doing some heavy lifting. What is it omitting? If only the church provided its own manuscript of that conference report. Alas, it does not. 1899 is too far back for its "official" archives to reach.

![[tithing2.png]]

>_I plead with you in the name of the Lord, and I pray that every man, woman and child ==who has means== shall pay one tenth of their income as a tithing._

‚Äî _[1899 General Conference Report](https://archive.org/details/conferencereport1899sa/page/28/mode/2up?q=who+has+means)_, archive.org

**‚Äúwho has means‚Äù** changes the context of this commandment. It necessarily excludes those who are impoverished. ‚ÄúI plead‚Äù does not really sound like it should be equated to ‚Äúthus saith the Lord‚Äù.

Also note in the top right corner of that image is year-over-year comparisons of tithing money "paid" in July - September, 1808 - 1809. I wonder why they stopped publishing information like that?

&nbsp;

## Joseph F Smith
>_Furthermore, I want to say to you, we may not be able to reach it right away, but we expect to see the day when ==we will not have to ask you for one dollar of donation== for any purpose, except that which you volunteer to give of your own accord, because we will have tithes sufficient in the storehouse of the Lord to pay ==everything that is needful== for the advancement of the kingdom of God._

‚Äî _[Chapter 31: Obedience to the Law of Tithing](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-f-smith/chapter-31?lang=eng&id=p26#p26)_, Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph¬†F. Smith

This quote from the prophet in 1907 says we won‚Äôt need to ask you to pay tithing once we have enough to be self-sufficient.

$100 billion evidently isn‚Äôt enough to be self-sufficient. ‚ÄúEverything that is needful‚Äù seems to have developed a lot since 1907. Everything that is needful seems to include stock holdings and real estate.

I could imagine someone defending this quote by pointing to the qualifier "*except that which you volunteer to give of your own accord*," and that it is what's happening today. I don't buy it‚Äî if salvation is gatekept behind tithing, then it is not voluntary.
## Culture
### It's a privilege!
>One of the blessings of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is ==the privilege of paying tithing==. This privilege is a double blessing. By paying tithing, Church members show their gratitude to God for their blessings and their resolve to trust in the Lord rather than in material things. They also help further the work of the Lord in the earth, blessing others of God‚Äôs children with the opportunity to learn of Him and grow in the gospel.
>
>==[[#City Creek Mall|Tithing funds are always used for the Lord‚Äôs purposes]]==‚Äîto build and maintain temples and meetinghouses, to sustain missionary work, to educate Church members, and to carry on the work of the Lord throughout the world.

‚Äî _[Topics and Questions: Tithing](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/tithing?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)_, Overview

&nbsp;

>. . . and then [my mother] thanked our Heavenly Father for ==the privilege of living the law of tithing==. I immediately experienced a feeling of comfort and assurance. Living ==the law of the tithe was a privilege== and would bring blessings.

‚Äî _[Tithing: A Privilege](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1998/04/tithing-a-privilege?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)_, Elder Ronald E. Poelman, General Conference April 1998

&nbsp;

To me, this is such a fascinating word choice. Can that privilege be revoked? Is the law of consecration a privilege that got revoked? Are other commandments described as privileges?
## Where does the money go?
We don‚Äôt have access to their financial documents, but we can point to public records of what the church owns.

Do we have access to the church‚Äôs 990 non-profit forms?

Do we have access to complete independently audited financial documents?

When was the last time your ward‚Äôs budget had enough to cover girls‚Äô camp?

How do we grapple with the cognitive dissonance of paying 10% of your money, but still needing to engage in fundraising efforts?
### Tithing Slip
The bottom of the tithing slip tells you everything you need to know:

![[tithing3.png]]

> _‚ÄúThough reasonable efforts will be made globally to use donations as designated, all donations become the Church‚Äôs property and will be used at the Church‚Äôs sole discretion to further the Church‚Äôs overall mission.‚Äù_

So, in essence, it doesn‚Äôt matter where the money is paid _from_‚Ä¶ it all gets used however the church sees fit, so the expectation is that it is used for everything.
### Public Information
>The Mormon Church's real-estate empire ==easily exceeds $1 billion==, including ==farms and ranches== in the West and Midwest, buildings and apartments on the West Coast and a huge chunk of land in central Florida, The Arizona Republic reported Tuesday.
> 
> Given its enormous ==**income from tithing and business operations**==, it appears the church is investing several hundred million dollars a year in ==securities and real estate==, the newspaper said in the third installment of a four-part series on the holdings of the Utah-based church. "I would say they're probably ==one of the largest private owners of farmland in the United States==," said John Scott, professor of land economics and farm management at the University of Illinois, although he hasn't compiled records to prove that.
> 
> Officials of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ==refuse to disclose information about real-estate holdings, even to members==, saying such information would distract from the church's ecclesiastical mission.

‚Äî _[LDS CHURCH REAL-ESTATE HOLDINGS INCLUDE FARMS, RANCHES, BUILDINGS](https://www.deseret.com/1991/7/2/18928879/lds-church-real-estate-holdings-include-farms-ranches-buildings)_, Deseret News ==1991==

If I keep going, it'll just be a wall of highlighted text...

Need I remind readers that Deseret News is [[Sources and Links#Deseret News|owned by the LDS Church]].

&nbsp;

> The church owns and manages two different types of businesses ‚Äì non-profit and for-profit. . . . On the other hand, ==Deseret News and the City Creek shopping center== in downtown Salt Lake City are **for-profit** business ‚Äì both owned and operated by Corporation of the Presiding Bishop, the business division of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
> 
> The majority of the church‚Äôs for-profit companies are run¬†under a holding company called Deseret Management Corporation. ==The Deseret Management Corporation board of directors== is made up of the three members of the First Presidency, three rotating members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric.

&nbsp;

If you‚Äôre a billionaire, they‚Äôve even got a special donation avenue for you, via LDS Philanthropies, [Private Foundation](https://philanthropies.churchofjesuschrist.org/gift-planning/how-to-give/family-directed-giving-tools/private-foundation). Is this a problem? Strictly speaking, no, it isn't morally wrong, but it certainly doesn't feel like they're asking for donations to support The Lord's work here on earth. In fact...

>Private foundations have been a popular and effective method ==for wealthy families to create a family legacy of philanthropy==.
> 
>. . .
> 
>There are many advantages of a private foundation:
> 
>**Personal advantage:** creating a private foundation is in essence ==creating one's own personal charity==; a private board is hand selected for the foundation.
> 
>**Family advantage:** a donor and his or her children frequently constitute the entire board of a private foundation; a private foundation can provide a structure for a family's charitable activities; ==family members can be involved in making grants and helping future generations understand the meaning of philanthropy==.
> 
>**Control advantage:** ==private foundations provide great freedom and spontaneity== in gift giving. The donor and the foundation's board have absolute control and can hire their own staff; they can choose which charities to benefit.

‚Äî *Excerpts from the LDS Philanthropies intake page* (link above)

so... what the fuck.

This is an avenue for PR, and so that "wealthy families" can feel like being raised as billionaires isn't actually bad. Even your kids can comprise the entire board of directors, and have autonomy to decide how the money is spent! I find this very upsetting- Is this what Jesus taught? 

[Luke 11:39-43](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/6?lang=eng&id=p20-p21#p20), [14:12-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/14?lang=eng&id=p12-p14#p12), [Mark 10:20-23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/14?lang=eng&id=p12-p14#p12), and [12:41-44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/12?lang=eng&id=p41-p44#p41) would all like to have a word with you.

We can hype up how great it is to build up your own personal charity with a private board of directors for future generations to laud how generous you are, but if you're going to do that, don't be the same organization that [teaches](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow?lang=eng&id=p5-p8#p5) us [about](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/57uchtdorf?lang=eng&id=p2-p4#p2) the [Widow's Mite](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven?lang=eng&id=p25-p30#p25). _This is self-aggrandizement_.

God bless America, if I keep reading into this my notes will devolve further into chaotic ranting üôÉ
### City Creek Mall
Chronologically, the first time I recall hearing about this was in General Conference, from Gordon Hinckley himself:

>We feel we have a compelling responsibility to protect the environment of the Salt Lake Temple. . . . We have felt it imperative to do something to revitalize this area. But I wish to give the entire Church the assurance that ==tithing funds have not and will not be used to acquire this property. Nor will they be used in developing it for commercial purposes.==
>
>Funds for this have come and will come from those ==commercial entities owned by the Church==. These resources, together with the ==earnings of invested reserve funds==, will accommodate this program.

The Church undertook the City Creek project to ==protect the environment around Temple Square==.

_[Forbes Covers City Creek Project](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/forbes-covers-city-creek-project)_, Church Newsroom

Protect the environment? Protect from what? This sounds like gentrification with extra steps. 
No, really, that just sounds like gentrification, full stop.

Next up: that Forbes article that the LDS Newsroom got excited about.

&nbsp;

> Over the next few years, with an investment estimated locally at ==$2 billion==, developers hope to transform a 20-acre swath of the city's now-uninspired central core. By 2012 they hope to create a model downtown district with a whole new ==array of retail shops and residential towers accommodating some 700 units==.
> 
> . . .
> 
> The driving force here is not economics, but the desire of Salt Lake's most powerful institution, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, to salvage its immediate neighborhoods. "The church's primary notion is to ==protect the Temple Square and the headquarters of the Church==," explains Mark Gibbons, president of City Creek Reserve, the church's development arm. "That's first and foremost. This development would not have been done just on a financial basis, I can tell you that."

‚Äî _[Salt Lake City's Sacred Space](https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/29/salt-lake-city-urban-sacred-opinions-columnists-joel-kotkin.html?sh=195613f0c5a1)_, Forbes

Protect from what?

*PROTECT FROM WHAT, MARK GIBBONS?*

>But whoso hath this world‚Äôs good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?

‚Äî [1 John 3:17-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3?lang=eng&id=p17-p18#p17)

Or, in layman's terms, if you have spare resources and see someone without resources, and opt not to share, how can you say you love God? Don't just say you love God, do something about that.

‚Äî _[City Creek Center Opens](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/city-creek-center-an-economic-revitalization)_, Church Newsroom

Boy, this... This is quite the sight. They sure seem excited about this project. A religious institution having _literally any_ involvement, despite whatever public assurances they give us, is upsetting to me. Is _this_ what Jesus taught?

I don't think I need to point out that the City Creek project is not a homeless shelter, not a soup kitchen, not a hospital, not a food bank, not subsidized housing, neither affordable housing, it's a shopping mall for middle class folks. Rent there is $[2,329](https://www.apartments.com/city-creek-landing-salt-lake-city-ut/4q97s7j/) - $[6,533](https://www.homes.com/property/city-creek-landing-salt-lake-city-ut/1kzy718my8b8y/), as of March 2024. Those links are to third party sites, because to no one's surprise, [City Creek Landing](https://www.citycreeklanding.com/floorplans)'s official site doesn't list the rent‚Äî only the deposit.

>It's ==Utah's Rodeo Drive== without the stuffiness.¬†City Creek is home to the ==national, luxury, and local brands== you love in one of the most unique shopping environments in the country.

‚Äî _[City Creek Center ‚Äì Shopping Elevated](https://www.utah.com/articles/post/city-creek-shopping-dining/#)_, utah.com ([[Sources and Links#[Deseret Management Corporation](https //www.deseretmanagement.com/ our-companies)|owned by the church]])

Don't forget to check out their list of [stores](https://shopcitycreekcenter.com/stores/) that are paying the Church to be in their mall. You can't even fucking [park there](https://citycreekparking.com/) without paying.

Is _this_ what Jesus taught? Is this a charitable organization with no independent audits, no public financial records, or accountability that you want to donate to?

### What's wrong with this? 
Take a step back and think rationally, maybe without cursing.

Yes, the Church is within its rights to do this. They're accountable only to themselves. They didn't outright create a mall, there was a mall already there. It's downtown Salt Lake. A high-rise and a shopping center go in downtown, it's not out of place, nor is it misplaced. I don't have a source handy, but I had heard the claim that since the LDS faith practically founded Salt Lake, they have stakes, connections, ownership partially or wholly in industries and businesses. Is that, on its face, wrong? No. 

**However...**

Imagine seeing the Catholic Church buying up some established McDonald's franchises. Imagine the JW's Watchtower buying ownership of plastics manufacturing. 7th day Adventist owning a bus fleet, or railway.

Now picture the LDS church owning a shopping mall and apartment complex. 

None of those things are pearl-clutching revelations to bring the masses to grab their pitchforks and start lynching. They definitely feel out of place- the public image of these organizations and religions is that they're charitable, running on donations, not engaging in any commercial business. I feel a lot of cognitive dissonance reading about it. *I was raised to believe that the Church runs on donated tithes.* 

## Where **should** the money go?
A shopping center that the church itself describes as luxurious? Extravagant temple furnishings? All for Jesus Christ, the man who was born in a stable, who taught sermons on boats, on the sides of roads, and on top of hills. The man who disliked extravagance. **The man who said ‚ÄúIf you love me, feed my sheep.‚Äù**

But of course, that one story about him approving of the woman anointing his feet with oil totally translates to aggrandizing affluence.

> So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. ==He saith unto him, Feed my lambs==.
>
> He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. ==He saith unto him, Feed my sheep==.
>
> He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. ==Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep==.

‚Äî _[John 21:15-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21?lang=eng&id=p15-p17#p15)_

Idk, seems important. Are we going to interpret this as doing baptisms for the dead, while our living fellow humans are languishing in squalor?

>But Solomon built him an house.
>
>==Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands==; as saith the prophet,
>
>Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: ==what house will ye build me?== saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?
>
>Hath not my hand made all these things?

‚Äî _[Acts 7:47-50](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/7?lang=eng&id=p47-p50#p47)_

Somehow, we can read this and call LDS temples ‚Äúhouse of the lord.‚Äù
## Charitable efforts
> _In_ [_a lecture given_](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865655946/At-Oxford-Elder-Oaks-says-religions-value-evident-in-refugee-crisis.html?pg=all) last month at the University of Oxford, Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said that each year The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints spends about ==$40 million on welfare, humanitarian and other LDS Church-sponsored projects== around the world and has done so for more than 30 years.
>
> _That would account for approximately ==$1.2 billion on welfare and humanitarian efforts over the past 30 years==. Elder Oaks also said that in the last year alone, Mormon volunteers have devoted 25 million hours of labor._
>
> _‚ÄúIn the year 2015 we had 177 emergency response projects in 56 countries,‚Äù Elder Oaks said. ‚ÄúIn addition, we had hundreds of projects that impacted more than 1 million people in seven other categories of assistance, such as clean water, immunization and vision care.‚Äù_

‚Äî _[LDS Church welfare, humanitarian efforts average $40 million per year, apostle says](https://www.deseret.com/2016/7/12/20591934/lds-church-welfare-humanitarian-efforts-average-40-million-per-year-apostle-says)_, Deseret News, 12 July 2016

$1.2 billion is a big number. It‚Äôs a much smaller number when we realize it‚Äôs spread across thirty years. I will concede that $40 million is also a big number. 

That third paragraph is worth acknowledging- providing clean water & immunization is a real solid. Unironically, good job. Those are important things that real humans in the world struggle to secure for themselves.

Also, don't overlook the utterance of the forbidden word "Mormon."

I wonder if $40,000,000 places the LDS church among the top charitable donors?
## Charity lists
### Forbes
> _Overall, the nation‚Äôs top 100 charities took in a combined $58.8 billion in private donations in their most recently reported fiscal years, an 8% increase. In a country with more than one million nonprofits, they received one-eighth of all charitable giving. Combined with the 10% increase the 100 posted last year, this marks the highest two-year gain in the 24 years that Forbes has been putting together this list. The cutoff for this year‚Äôs list‚ÄîNo.¬†100‚Äîwas $181 million in donations, up from $167 million in 2021._

Is the five year gap between 2016 and 2021 too big for a fair comparison? If not, the bottom of this list donated 4.175 times more than the LDS church had. That makes it 23.9% of the minimum cut-off to make the top 100 list.

Sure, 40 million is not nothing, and one could argue that the church has done some good with it. I'm not claiming that the money was wasted. I'm saying that flexing that number doesn't make you look as good as you think it does.

Well, I guess I don‚Äôt need to spend any more time looking into the LDS church on this site.
