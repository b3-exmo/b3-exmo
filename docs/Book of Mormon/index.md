# 📘 Book of Mormon

> _…the Book of Mormon is the keystone of [our] testimony. Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon._

— President Ezra T. Benson, [The Book of Mormon - Keystone of Our Religion](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng)

&nbsp;

> _…everything in the Church – everything – rises or falls on the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon and, by implication, the Prophet Joseph Smith’s account of how it came forth…It sounds like a ‘sudden death’ proposition to me. Either the Book of Mormon is what the Prophet Joseph said it is or this Church and its founder are false, fraudulent, a deception from the first instance onward._

— President Jeffrey R. Holland, [True or False, New Era, June 1995](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/1995/06/true-or-false?lang=eng)

## Two sets of scripture

What, _specifically_, does the Bible lack that the BoM clears up?

Yes, it’s another testament of Christ. Not focusing on that argument. What doctrine did BoM add?

- Infant Baptism is wrong
- ???

Does not talk about temples, marriage, eternal marriage, afterlife, church leadership outside of First Presidency + Q15.

Does it demonstrate the need for prophets?

There are no “truly” LDS doctrines are in there:

- Temples
- Temple ordinances
- Two priesthood tiers (by whatever name we prefer)
- Organization of church

Even if it was true, the Book of Mormon’s main value would be a witness that Christ visited somewhere on the American continents and briefly ministered to the indigenous peoples within a small radius of His “landing spot.” But if you already believe in Christ, even that is basically just a fun fact.

So much of Jesus’ ministry in the BoM was a repetition of the sermon on the mount, like in the New Testament. He set up sacrament communion, like he did in the New Testament.

Jesus presenting no meaningfully new information, but having a direct copy of the KJV New Testament, might lead a skeptical person to not see this testament of Christ as being very useful.

BoM supports the idea of “other sheep I have which are not of this fold”… but that is a bit vague in and of itself. Could have just as easily gone to Cape Town in South Africa. Or Mongolia. Don’t quote me on where humans were in 33 AD, I’m making some broad assumptions.

### **Fullness of the Gospel**
For having everything we need to have [[Restoration|a fully restored]] church, it seems to leave a lot out. No part of temple ceremonies/ordinances are in BoM, they’re in PoGP or Bible.

### Pride cycle
An awful lot of the Book of Mormon is pride cycle:

- Prophet XYZ calls upon wicked people to repent; issues commands
- Wicked people laugh at Silly Prophet; disobey commands
- Wicked people are punished by bad fortune.
- Righteous people that obey Prophet XYZ are blessed by good fortune.
- Rinse and repeat

I’ve heard the sentiment expressed that this pride cycle happens “over and over”, “time and time again”. Sure, I’m not going to dispute its repetitions, but… Can we point to a solid count? How many times specifically was it outlined, even if indirectly?

Could argue that Laman & Lemuel are an example, but in a less literal sense than the Gadianton Robbers.

If one were to studiously read through the BoM multiple times in a year, as is alluded to being an ideal by church leadership, iterating over the same finite stories and examples of the pride cycle could lead one to conclude that it’s a lot more prevalent than it really is. Could that be why the number of times it appears is only articulated in vague terms?

## For our day, or for JS’ day?

BoM answered a lot of the hotly debated controversies of the early 1800’s 2nd Great Awakening, Calvinism, Rationalism, Deism, etc.

- Is a literal baptism required?
- Does God approve of Infant [[Baptism]]?
- What does God think of Catholics?
- Which child of Noah did the Native Americans descend from?
- Was God behind the founding of the USA?

We don’t really think about these topics today, but in the 1820’s - 1830’s these dominated the headlines. And then a magical treasure digger announces that he found a book that has answers to all of these questions.

Says nothing about:

- LGBT+
- climate change
- overpopulation
- globalism, patriotism
- multiculturalism
- drugs
- poverty
- mental illness
- assault rifles
- weapons of mass destruction
- abortion

Does make prophecies about:

- War of 1812
- Christopher Columbus
- Mary
- Lots of stuff about Jesus
- Even Joseph Smith himself!

Whose day was it written for?

According to David A Bednar…

> _“The Book of Mormon is not a book of history. The Book of Mormon is a book about the future.”_

Thanks, buddy. That clears it right up.

## Baptism, generally

People wouldn’t have worried about their baby dying before being baptized if they had temples where the work could later be done by proxy.

If the Nephites were practicing baptism for the dead, there would have been no need for Mormon (the prophet) to speak against infant baptism.

If the age of accountability is an eternal principle, then Nephites wouldn’t bother at all. Not discounting the mourning for lost family members, of course.

## JST vs BoM

Isn’t JST and BoM the most accurate translations of Christ’s everlasting message?
### KJV: Matthew 7:1

> _Judge not, that ye be not judged._

_From [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7?lang=eng&id=1-27#p1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7?lang=eng&id=1-27#p1)_

### JST: Matthew 7:1-2

> _1 Now these are the words which Jesus taught his disciples that they should say unto the people._

> _2 Judge not unrighteously, that ye be not judged; but judge righteous judgment._

[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-matt/7?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-matt/7?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1)

### 3 Nephi 14:1

> _And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged._

BoM is “the most correct book” on the planet, something to that affect.

Joseph smith later translated parts of the Bible. Circumstances around that I’m not really familiar with, but why would those two translations vary so much?

[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-matt/7?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-matt/7?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1)

## Other example

Sermon on the Mount appears in 3 Nephi 13, Matt 6 KJV, and Matt 6 JST. There’s enough discrepancy for not all claims to be true; either BoM is not “the most correct of any book on earth” or JST is bunk. Why wouldn’t the BoM version include the JST edits?
### Raca
> *But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of his judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, ==Raca==, shall be in danger of the ==council==; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.*

[3 Nephi 12:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)

This verse references a KJV “Anglicization” of the Greek text in which Raca has been ported from Aramaic ‘Reka’. The Nephites didn’t speak Greek. The Nephites didn’t speak Aramaic.

It is NOT a Hebrew word. It is NOT an Egyptian word.

That verse is COPIED from the KJV of the New Testament. It was not written as such on any Hebrew or Reformed Egyptian plates.

WORSE is the reference to ‘council’. All biblical scholars recognize this is in reference to the Jewish Councils governing offenses in Jerusalem. Specifically the Sanhedrin. There was NO Sanhedrin among the Nephites or in the New World; if Sanhedrin was relevant in 600 BC, BoM outlines overhauls to governance and justiciary a few times. Sanhedrin may be an old oral legend, being 600 years displaced. There’s no way a Nephite in the New World would call their brother “Raca” and after having done so, be subject to the punishment of the Sanhedrin.

**This passage would have been meaningless to the Nephites.** Being meaningless, they probably wouldn’t have written it down.
Really, now. Here are the times where, during the physical ministry of Jesus Christ, savior of all mankind, in the resurrected flesh, people just said 'yeah he said some other stuff too idk'

> ***6** And now there ==cannot be written== in this book even a hundredth part of the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people;*

[3 Ne 26:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)

&nbsp;

>***16** Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.*
>
>***17** And it came to pass that the disciples whom Jesus had chosen began from that time forth to baptize and to teach as many as did come unto them; and as many as were baptized in the name of Jesus were filled with the Holy Ghost.*
>
>***18** And many of them saw and heard unspeakable things, which are ==not lawful to be written==.*

[3 Ne 26:16-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p16-p18#p16)

&nbsp;

>***15** And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, and the things which he prayed ==cannot be written==, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.*
>
>***16** And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;*
>
>***17** And no tongue can ==speak, neither can there be written by any man==, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.*

[3 Ne 17:15-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p15-p17#p15)

&nbsp;

>***17** And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them ==cannot be written==, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book. And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.*

[3 Ne 7:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)

&nbsp;

>***32** And tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, ==neither can be written== by man the words which he prayed.*
>
>***33** And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed.*
>
>***34** Nevertheless, so great and marvelous were the words which he prayed that ==they cannot be written==, neither can they be uttered by man.*

[3 Ne 19:32-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p32-p34#p32)

&nbsp;

But the one of the few things they got written down verbatim wouldn't mean a damned thing outside of Judaism.

This verse (among hundreds of others) was copied from the English KJV available to Joseph Smith with him NOT knowing what he was copying.

## Probability / Occam’s Razor

The official story is that Joseph was visited by a Native American ghost who led him to a buried golden book in the style of 19th century New England folk magic. The book was written in a language and script found nowhere else in history, though the characters look amazingly similar to modern English letters with extra lines or turned upside down. Joseph translated it using a magic rock he found in a well and previously used to search for buried Native American treasure. The original book has since disappeared, but we can confirm without a doubt that Joseph’s later translation activities were fabricated based on existing source documents.

The book is a story about a massive, thousand-year civilization for which there is no supporting linguistic, archaeological, or genetic evidence. It copies large excerpts from the King James Bible edition to which Joseph had access, including translation errors and writings that didn’t exist when the Book of Mormon peoples were supposed to have left Jerusalem. Joseph claimed it to be a legitimate translation.

You can either believe that ridiculous story, or you can believe that a guy wrote a book quickly. This is a very easy one; if you find “a guy wrote a book quickly” to be less plausible than the story above, then you have a terrible grasp of probability.

## Jewish Origin

Being of Hebrew/Jerusalem origins there should be some mention of Jewish traditions, Kosher preparations of food, Hebraic prayers, and more references to Moses and the Law.

Lehi and his family being fresh out of Jerusalem didn’t have much mention of Judaic tradition or culture. I guess they’d be found in the 116 pages, book of Lehi?

“Foolish traditions of our fathers” are mentioned… but never elaborated on. Could those be Jewish traditions?

There are simple references to Clean and Unclean meats, but nothing beyond that show a Jewish origin.

## Greek

The Greek language was used throughout the Roman Empire at the time of Christ; therefore, the New Testament was written in Greek and the words _Alpha and Omega_ were well understood. The Nephites, however, were supposed to have left Jerusalem 600 years before the time of Christ, before the Roman empire was present to introduce Greek, and therefore the Nephites would not have been familiar with these words.

If Jesus had told the Nephites that He was “Alpha and Omega,” it would have had absolutely no meaning to them. Yet that passage is still included, when Jesus’ visit in 3rd Nephi is so heavily abbreviated (he did many other things that cannot be written)

When the author of the _Book of Mormon_ lifted these words from the book of Revelation he evidently did not realize that they were from the Greek language.

Joseph Smith seems to have been oblivious to the fact that the _Book of Mormon_ contains Greek words. When it was suggested that the word Mormon came from the Greek, he stated: “This is not the case. There was _no_ Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, … translated the Book of Mormon” ([Times and Seasons, vol. 4, p. 194](https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/8517)). The appearance of Greek words in the _Book of Mormon_—especially the words _Alpha and Omega_—is another evidence that it is not an ancient record, but rather a modern composition.

## Historicity
Funny how we have numerous [Cuneiform tablets](https://www.loc.gov/collections/cuneiform-tablets/about-this-collection/) from ancient Sumeria (around 2100 BC), a civilization smaller than the Nephites, outlining even mundane things as school assignments & receipts. But... for a civilization as vast, populous and robust as Zerahemla, we've got... nothing.
