# üìò Book of Mormon

> _‚Ä¶the Book of Mormon is the keystone of [our] testimony. Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon._

‚Äî _[The Book of Mormon - Keystone of Our Religion](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng)_, President Ezra T. Benson, General Conference October 1986

&nbsp;

> _‚Ä¶everything in the Church ‚Äì everything ‚Äì rises or falls on the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon and, by implication, the Prophet Joseph Smith‚Äôs account of how it came forth‚Ä¶It sounds like a ‚Äòsudden death‚Äô proposition to me. Either the Book of Mormon is what the Prophet Joseph said it is or this Church and its founder are false, fraudulent, a deception from the first instance onward._

## Fullness of the Gospel
What, _specifically_, does the Bible lack that the Book of Mormon clears up? What doctrine did it add?

- Infant Baptism is wrong
- ???

&nbsp;

It does not talk about temples, marriage, eternal marriage, afterlife, church leadership outside of First Presidency + Q15. Does it *demonstrate the need* for prophets? 

There are no ‚Äútruly‚Äù LDS doctrines are in there:

- Temples
- Temple ordinances
- Two priesthood tiers (by whatever name we prefer)
- Organization & centralization of **a** church, **the** true church

&nbsp;

If this book was true, the Book of Mormon‚Äôs main value would be a witness that Christ visited somewhere on the American continents and briefly ministered to the indigenous peoples within a small radius of His ‚Äúlanding spot.‚Äù **But if you already believe in Christ, that is basically just a fun fact.** Jesus presents no meaningfully new information, but his teachings are a direct copy of the KJV New Testament. It's enough to lead a skeptical reader to not see this testament of Christ as being very useful. The Book of Mormon supports the idea of ‚Äúother sheep I have which are not of this fold‚Äù‚Ä¶ but that is a bit vague in and of itself. Could have just as easily gone to Cape Town in South Africa. Or Mongolia. 

If the Book of Mormon is meant to be evidence of [[Restoration|a fully restored]] church, it seems to leave a lot out. So much of the modern LDS church seems to be founded on the Doctrine & Covenants, or the Pearl of Great Price.

### Pride cycle vs Agency
*Pride precedeth the fall*. Pride comes from righteous living. Do you see a problem with this? "You should strive and try and live the gospel. but... when you do... here's what's going to happen."

An awful lot of the Book of Mormon is what its adherents call the pride cycle:

- God blesses righteous, obedient people 
- People become prideful & stop being obedient 
- God has to punish the sinful, prideful people
- People become humble & righteous
- Rinse and repeat. 

God rewards your obedience and righteousness with a reward corrupts you, bringing you to fall. God keeps perpetuating this cycle, and is going to keep the Lamanites a short distance away to use as a punishing tool for when you *obey too much*.

Who breaks the cycle? Is it us? Are we meant to **not** be corrupted by God when he blesses us? Don't forget that we're not alone in this perpetual cycle‚Äî God is the one who keeps blessing us. I won't be prideful anymore if God stops *making* me prideful. 

God has had a more than a few years of experience with this cycle, you'd think he'd know the appropriate amount of 'bless' to bestow, and it always seems to be too much. That's why the pride cycle continues. Is it the fault of me, an imperfect mortal, susceptible to corruption? Is it my fault that God made me become prideful whenever I get blessed by God? Is God trying to tell me that I shouldn't become humble and obedient? He sure seems to want to disincentivize that.

&nbsp;

I‚Äôve heard the sentiment expressed that this pride cycle happens ‚Äúover and over‚Äù, ‚Äútime and time again‚Äù. Sure, I‚Äôm not going to dispute its repetitions, but‚Ä¶ Can we point to a solid count? How many times specifically was it outlined, even if indirectly?

Could argue that Laman & Lemuel are an example, but in a less literal sense than the Gadianton Robbers.

If one were to studiously read through the BoM multiple times in a year, as is alluded to being an ideal by church leadership, iterating over the same finite stories and examples of the pride cycle could lead one to conclude that it‚Äôs a lot more prevalent than it really is. Could that be why the number of times it appears is only articulated in vague terms?

&nbsp;

I could imagine this being very closely related to Prosperity Gospel. I [[TODO|ought to]] write some notes about that.

&nbsp;

### Natural Man
> For ==the natural man is an enemy to God==, and ==has been== from the fall of Adam, and ==will be==, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.

‚Äî _[Mosiah 3:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19)_

One central tenant of the LDS faith is that because we are God's children, we can [[Becoming Gods|grow up to become like God]]. We have existed forever, if as "intelligences" that lived (?) with our father- the whole point of mortality is to qualify to be like god by attaining a body etc. We're created in his image. We are created by god, to one day become a god- we're growing up, we're godlings, we're little wimpy baby gods. Right?

But... This set of scripture that Moroni had to go through such great efforts to preserve for Joseph Smith to translate is telling us we're God's enemy, and he made us that way. [[Theology#Oversimplification|Why does god hate his creations]]? By our very nature, by God's design, we are an enemy to God. What the hell.

#### A parable
Props to John Larsen for presenting and illustrating this idea in [his podcast](https://johnlarsen.org/mormon-expression/).

> Imagine you're sitting in the mall and and there's a father talking to his child who you can overhear. Put whatever scripture you want in the mouth of the father talking to the child. Just about any biblical passage he says would make you consider calling Child Protective Services.
>
> Imagine a parent in the mall scolding their child, saying "you little shit, you are an enemy of mine! You have been since the day you were born, and _always will be unless you do what I tell you to do_. You have to do everything I say or else you're my enemy." One step further, "you will never *not* be my enemy, unless I punish your brother. You, on your own, will never be good enough."

I think it's a useful illustration- if our relationship to God is like that of a father and child, we can imagine literally a father and child having such an interaction as a third party.

&nbsp;

## For our day, or for JS‚Äô day?
BoM answered a lot of the hotly debated controversies of the early 1800‚Äôs 2nd Great Awakening, Calvinism, Rationalism, Deism, etc.

- Is a literal baptism required?
- Does God approve of Infant [[Baptism]]?
- What does God think of Catholics?
- Which child of Noah did the Native Americans descend from?
- Was God behind the founding of the USA?

We don‚Äôt really think about these topics today, but in the 1820‚Äôs - 1830‚Äôs these dominated the headlines. And then a magical treasure digger announces that he found a book that has answers to all of these questions.

Says nothing about:

- LGBT+
- climate change
- overpopulation
- globalism, patriotism
- multiculturalism
- drugs
- poverty
- mental illness
- assault rifles
- weapons of mass destruction
- abortion

Does make prophecies about:

- War of 1812
- Christopher Columbus
- Mary
- Lots of stuff about Jesus
- Even Joseph Smith himself!

Whose day was it written for?

According to David A Bednar‚Ä¶

> _‚ÄúThe Book of Mormon is not a book of history. The Book of Mormon is a book about the future.‚Äù_

‚Äî _[Elder Bednar Ministers in Amman, Jordan](https://news-middleeast.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/elder-bednar-ministers-in-amman-jordan)_, Church Newsroom, 
23 October 2021

Thanks, buddy. That clears it right up.

&nbsp;

### Another Testament of Christ
Christ's presence gets hyped up *a lot* in this book.

They count down for 600 years, leading up to Christ's return. The entire book is about this event, leading up to this singular event‚Äî the event of a god walking among us, to deliver a message. Fast forward to afterward, we have Mormon and Moroni hauling around ~450 lbs of metal plates in a desperate effort to preserve the records for future generations. After all, it was written for our day, right?

We have the Bible, right? Jesus was crucified, rose again, but in that interim when he is sealed away in that tomb, he appears in the New World to preach. (That's what I recall hearing in seminary- Jesus' visit to America was during those 2 - 3 days after mortal death) This necessarily must be *the most important thing* to have ever been told to all of humanity, you build up to Third Nephi with this hushed awe and wonderment, ready for divine insights and guidance‚Äî everything that has happened in the world is leading up to this one great moment to change all of humanity, God himself is descending, appearing in a physical manifestation to prove his identity and authority. God is appearing to the other side of the world, because he loves and cares for those people enough to appear and minister to them. The record of those teachings will be, must be preserved, unaltered by priests or clergymen‚Äî the message is pure, given straight from God's mouth to us. The entire point of the Book of Mormon is to deliver *this message*:

And what is it? It's the sermon on the mount exactly as it appears in the New Testament. Plus a [[#Cannot be written|bunch of other stuff we didn't write down]]. It's a re-run.

Huh. If I didn't know any better, I might assume that Joseph just plagiarized these passages.

Jesus does, by definition, visit the new world, but not all of it. He goes to one city. Not only that, but Zerahemla's buildings and infrastructure just got completely leveled- there isn't an auditorium or a gathering place. In an enclosed room, one's voice might reverberate from the walls enough to reach folks in the back row. They don't have rooms or buildings, just rubble and debris. Only the first 100 - 150 people to get to Jesus could hear him talk. And what does he talk about? The exact same message, suspiciously in the same vernacular and style as the King James Version of the New Testament, repeated.

One could argue that this emphasizes how important that message is, that native Americans need it too- but part of what's dramatic about this book is the idea that it survived such great lengths to preserve for us, today, in 2024 to read as convincing evidence that God's one true church has been restored. Those two ideas don't fit together. Was it [[#For our day, or for JS‚Äô day?|for us]], who already have the source material? Was it for *our day*, more of a temporal matter than demographic- for Mormonism to convince the rest of the world that we believe the same things? "See, we like Jesus' message too! We're not weird!"

&nbsp;

## Baptism revelation
People wouldn‚Äôt have worried about their baby dying before being baptized if they had temples where the work could later be done by proxy.

If the Nephites were practicing baptism for the dead, there would have been no need for Mormon (the prophet) to speak against infant baptism.

If the age of accountability is an eternal principle, then Nephites wouldn‚Äôt bother at all. Not discounting the mourning for lost family members, of course.

&nbsp;

## JST vs BoM
Isn‚Äôt JST and BoM the most accurate translations of Christ‚Äôs everlasting message?

Sermon on the Mount appears in 3 Nephi 13, Matt 6 KJV, and Matt 6 JST. There‚Äôs enough discrepancy for not all claims to be true; either BoM is not ‚Äúthe most correct of any book on earth‚Äù or JST is bunk. Why wouldn‚Äôt the BoM version include the JST edits?

| Judge not, that ye be not judged.<br><br>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. | Now these are the words which Jesus taught his disciples that they should say unto the people.<br><br>Judge not unrighteously, that ye be not judged; but judge righteous judgment. | And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.<br><br>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. |

Why would Joseph Smith's "translation" of the KJV vary so differently from Jesus teaching the exact same thing to the Nephites? ‚ÄúThe most correct book‚Äù on the planet, something to that affect.

## Anglicization
### Raca
> *But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of his judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother,¬†==Raca==, shall be in danger of the¬†==council==; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.*

‚Äî _[3 Nephi 12:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)_

This verse references a KJV ‚ÄúAnglicization‚Äù of the Greek text in which Raca has been ported from Aramaic ‚ÄòReka‚Äô. The Nephites didn‚Äôt speak Greek. The Nephites didn‚Äôt speak Aramaic.

It is NOT a Hebrew word. It is NOT an Egyptian word.

That verse is COPIED from the KJV of the New Testament. It was not written as such on any Hebrew or Reformed Egyptian plates.

WORSE is the reference to ‚Äòcouncil‚Äô. All biblical scholars recognize this is in reference to the Jewish Councils governing offenses in Jerusalem. Specifically the Sanhedrin. There was NO Sanhedrin among the Nephites or in the New World; if Sanhedrin was relevant in 600 BC, BoM outlines overhauls to governance and justiciary a few times. Sanhedrin may be an old oral legend, being 600 years displaced. There‚Äôs no way a Nephite in the New World would call their brother ‚ÄúRaca‚Äù and after having done so, be subject to the punishment of the Sanhedrin.

**This passage would have been meaningless to the Nephites.** Being meaningless, they probably wouldn‚Äôt have written it down.
Really, now. Here are the times where, during the physical ministry of Jesus Christ, savior of all mankind, in the resurrected flesh, the scribes just said 'yeah he said some other stuff too idk'

&nbsp;

### Cannot be written
> And now there ==cannot be written== in this book even a hundredth part of the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people;

‚Äî _[3 Ne 26:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)_

&nbsp;

I initially had these following passages quoted inline, but I think you can follow these links if you'd like to read some other examples:

- _[3 Ne 26:16-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p16-p18#p16)_
- _[3 Ne 17:15-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p15-p17#p15)_
- _[3 Ne 7:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)_
- _[3 Ne 19:32-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p32-p34#p32)_

But the one of the few things they got written down verbatim wouldn't mean a damned thing outside of Judaism. Perhaps they were [[BoM Changes#Intro Page|descendants of Israelites]], but don't forget that by this point they're 600+ years separated from Lehi.

&nbsp;

### Greek
The Greek language was used throughout the Roman Empire at the time of Christ; therefore, the New Testament was written in Greek and the words¬†_Alpha and Omega_¬†were well understood. The Nephites, however, were supposed to have left Jerusalem 600 years before the time of Christ, before the Roman empire was present to introduce Greek, and therefore the Nephites would not have been familiar with these words.

If Jesus had told the Nephites that He was ‚Äú[Alpha and Omega](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p18#p18),‚Äù it would have had absolutely no meaning to them. Yet that passage is still included, when Jesus‚Äô visit in 3rd Nephi is so heavily abbreviated (he did many other things that cannot be written)

When the author of the¬†_Book of Mormon_¬†lifted these words from the book of Revelation he evidently did not realize that they were from the Greek language.

> The _Book of Mormon_ also contains the name Timothy ([3 Nephi 19:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)). Timothy is a Greek name and never appears in the Old Testament. In the same verse that we find the name Timothy we also find the name Jonas. Jonas is the New Testament name for Jonah and is found in [Matthew 12:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/12?lang=eng&id=p39-p40#p39). Joseph Smith seems to have been oblivious to the fact that the¬†_Book of Mormon_¬†contains Greek words. When it was suggested that the word Mormon came from the Greek, he stated: ‚ÄúThis is not the case. There was¬†_no_¬†Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, ‚Ä¶ translated the Book of Mormon‚Äù ([Times and Seasons,¬†vol.¬†4, p.¬†194](https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/8517)). The appearance of Greek words in the¬†_Book of Mormon_‚Äîespecially the words¬†_Alpha and Omega_‚Äîis another evidence that it is not an ancient record, but rather a modern composition.

‚Äî _From [http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/changech5b.htm](http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/changech5b.htm)_

&nbsp;
## Probability / Occam‚Äôs Razor
The official story is that Joseph was visited by a Native American ghost who led him to a buried golden book in the style of 19th century New England folk magic. The book was written in a language and script found nowhere else in history, though the characters look amazingly similar to modern English letters with extra lines or turned upside down. Joseph translated it using a magic rock he found in a well and previously used to search for buried Native American treasure. The original book has since disappeared, but we can confirm without a doubt that Joseph‚Äôs later translation activities were fabricated based on existing source documents.

The book is a story about a massive, thousand-year civilization for which there is no supporting linguistic, archaeological, or genetic evidence. It copies large excerpts from the King James Bible edition to which Joseph had access, including translation errors and writings that didn‚Äôt exist when the Book of Mormon peoples were supposed to have left Jerusalem. Joseph claimed it to be a legitimate translation.

You can either believe that ridiculous story, or you can believe that a guy wrote a book quickly. This is a very easy one; if you find ‚Äúa guy wrote a book quickly‚Äù to be less plausible than the story above, then you have a terrible grasp of probability.

&nbsp;

## Jewish Origin
Being of Hebrew/Jerusalem origins there should be some mention of Jewish traditions, Kosher preparations of food, Hebraic prayers, and more references to Moses and the Law.

Lehi and his family being fresh out of Jerusalem didn‚Äôt have much mention of Judaic tradition or culture. I guess they‚Äôd be found in the 116 pages, book of Lehi?

‚ÄúFoolish traditions of our fathers‚Äù are mentioned‚Ä¶ but never elaborated on. Could those be Jewish traditions?

There are simple references to Clean and Unclean meats, but nothing beyond that show a Jewish origin.

## Extant artifacts
Funny how we have numerous [Cuneiform tablets](https://www.loc.gov/collections/cuneiform-tablets/about-this-collection/) from ancient Sumeria (around 2100 BC; 4100 years ago), a civilization smaller than the Nephites, outlining even mundane things as school assignments & receipts. But... for a civilization as vast, populous and robust as Zerahemla, we've got... nothing.
