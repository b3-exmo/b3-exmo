# Anachronisms
## Apostasy
How there could be an apostasy (no priesthood on the earth) if the 3 Nephites and John were still alive? Presumably they‚Äôre still around; what have they been doing for 1800 years? Those four were priesthood holders, right?

I suppose they didn't have the "office" of priesthood to qualify... ü§∑ whoops lmao
## Seeing God
The brother of Jared is described as having like the most faith ever, and so he was able to [see God‚Äôs finger](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p6-p8#p6)‚Ä¶ but Joseph Smith literally just prayed once and he got to see both Heavenly Father and Jesus. Their full bodies. Should we believe this means Joseph was super, uber, ultra-special faithful prior to the [[First Vision|first vision(s)]]?
## Jaredites
### Timeline
>_The Book of Mormon Jaredite King List gives only 7 exact dates (lifespans and reigns) for the Jaredite Chronology. The only real markers we have to build a working chronology from are firstly, the date of the ‚Äúdearth‚Äù or famine and megafauna extinction given in the narrative of Heth [Ether 9:30‚Äì34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p30-p34#p30). It‚Äôs important to note that it‚Äôs well established that Mastodons and other megafauna went extinct in most of continental North America at about 11 - 8,000 BC and the paleoindians role in killing them off and eating them amidst a major climate event (as explained in [Ether 9:30‚Äì34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p30-p34#p30)) is well documented in the archaeological record, so we must consider the possibility that if radiocarbon dates are not off (which they certainly may be for that period), then there is likely a large unknown break of thousands of years between the Jared to Heth, and the rest of the timeline._

### How many people died?
>*He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly [two millions](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng#note2a) of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children.*

‚Äî [Ether 15:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)

Perhaps not all two million were married. Perhaps not all men were of age to fight a hand-to-hand war.

Make a broad generalization that maybe they were: two million mighty men + two million wives + (averaged?) two and a half million children means for just the families of age to fight, we‚Äôre at six million people. This won‚Äôt count those too elderly to fight, or the civilization & infrastructure to support those who did not fight (need city governance and whatnot, I guess?)

Maybe I could extrapolate another 1 million for those not in the fight? Too old? Too young? Children were already counted, so‚Ä¶ maybe 7.5 million. Seven and a half million people and no signs at all of their existence, less than two thousand years ago.

Let‚Äôs compare that to battle deaths on the _western front_ in the First World War. In 4 years, about 4 million men died on the western front. That‚Äôs 4 years of intense artillery fire, machine guns, accurate rifles, poison gas, etc.

Actually, you know what‚Äî six to seven million is a number that has a pretty direct comparison to the [number of Jewish people killed during the holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe). To be clear, the only comparison I'm making here is the number of deaths, no further implications than that scale. Imagine numerous deaths on the scale of the 1940's holocaust, possibly greater, just... poofing away.

The idea that a bronze age civilizations would be capable of inflicting death on that scale‚Äî especially without leaving a trace‚Äî is patently absurd. The fact that the _entire civilization_ conveniently annihilated itself before the Nephites arrived is even more ridiculous.
### Wooden Submarines
Jaredites in wooden submarines. Jaredites with steel. Did [[Technology|steel]] technology exist in 8000 BCE?

Giving this any amount of critical evaluation makes it sound more ridiculous than inspiring or faith-promoting. No propulsion, no steering, constant flipping, no food stores, no potable water, no waste disposal, and no solid way to tell time or know how long it took. I'm not sure they knew how to measure the number of days- did they write it down, or just talk out a consensus once they made landfall? If it was written, what was it recorded on?

BoM describes Jaredites as having been ‚Äú[led by God from the Tower of Babel to the Americas](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/jaredites)‚Äù, which would place them in Babylon in Iraq. I‚Äôm open to correction, but my google-sleuthing led me to the Tower of Babel being in [Iraq, near Baghdad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YTsXjXz2s3otx2Ri9). I hope I'm not being bamboozled by some kind of tourist attraction.

Personally, I've never hiked more than ~5 miles in a day, with adequate hydration, modern footwear, etc. I don‚Äôt know how feasible it is to travel from [Baghdad, Iraq to Beirut, Lebanon](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Beirut,+Lebanon/Baghdad,+Baghdad+Governorate,+Iraq) (~580 miles of desert), or [to Tel Aviv, Israel](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Tel+Aviv,+Israel/Baghdad,+Baghdad+Governorate,+Iraq) (~650 miles of desert), but that sounds non-trivial to me.

Then comes the Atlantic. Closest point by my eyeball estimation is Cape Cod in Mass. If they went in a straight line, it would be 3433 miles. 2700+3433 = 6133 miles.

[Ether 6:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) records the duration of time as being 344 days. 6133 miles is a low estimate, straight lines. 6133 / 344 = ~17.8285. Assuming they had propulsion, navigation and steering, I might call that speed of 18 miles per day ‚Äúnot unreasonable.‚Äù However. It‚Äôs nearly a year of constant flipping around with only glowing stones as light. What did their animals eat for a year? 

I've heard the critical claim that the deseret beehives were in the barges as well- by my understanding, the bees were explicitly mentioned on the coast as the barges were being built, and never mentioned after. Were the hives brought along? Maybe. I hope not, I wouldn't want to be in a flipping submarine with stinging insects. That's one point that [[Sources and Links|FAIR]] and I can [agree on](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:Did_the_Jaredites_bring_swarms_of_bees_across_the_ocean_in_their_barges).

Nephi & friends were able to invoke divine intervention so they wouldn‚Äôt have to cook their meat. That necessitates they still had to acquire the meat, though. I suppose the Jaredites got some fish when the barge flipped? How did they handle waste? A month in, every square inch of the inside would be covered in poop. An hour in and they've got some stressed livestock, probably trying to break out.
## Animals
Post Ice age and pre-columbian horses. [Or were they tapirs](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Animals/Horses/Loanshifting:_deer_and_tapirs)?

Animals indigenous to the Americas:

- Black bears
- Brown bears
- Jaguar
- Bald Eagle
- Llamas
- Cougars
- Coyotes
- Bison
- Anaconda
- Alligator
- [Tapir](https://byustudies.byu.edu/article/animals-in-the-book-of-mormon-challenges-and-perspectives/)

Animals not indigenous to Americas:
- Horses
- Lions
- Dragons

Take a guess which lists‚Äô animals appear in the Book of Mormon, of ancient Americas?

What does [lds.org](http://lds.org) say about animals? [Not much](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2008/08/for-little-friends/book-of-mormon-animals?lang=eng).
