# BoM Changes

[_Changes in the Book of Mormon - Royal Skousen, 2002 FairMormon Conference_](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/conference/august-2002/changes-in-the-book-of-mormon)

I’ve seen the claim that 100,000+ changes have been made to the BoM over time. That figure would be a lot more impressive if it wasn't suspiciously round. Fortunately for us, we can [[#Enumeration of Changes|see them enumerated or tabulated]].

As far as I know, Joseph’s scribes for the first edition did not have education to add in punctuation or meaningful sentence structure. I don’t know what proportion of those changes are for punctuation marks.

**That doesn’t account for all of the changes, though.**

We can read the [1830 edition](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/7?dm=image-and-text&zm=zoom-inner&tm=expanded&p=7&s=undefined&sm=none) for ourselves, no less. It's a bit rough, but you can do it.

## Intro Page

Pre 2006

…the Lamanites, and they are ==the principal== ancestors of the American Indians

Post 2006

…the Lamanites, and they are ==among the== ancestors of the American Indians

Why did this get changed? Could it be due to criticism that Native American DNA shows little to no connection to the Middle East? If so, that suggests that the church isn’t going to double down on this claim.

### Former Inhabitants

> *He said there was a book deposited written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fullness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it as delivered by the Saviour to the ancient inhabitants.*

[History, 1838–1856, volume A-1 [23 December 1805–30 August 1834], p. 5, The Joseph Smith Papers](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/5?p=5)

See also [Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/js?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) in the intro section of the Book of Mormon.

Joseph asserts that Lamanites are “the former inhabitants” of this continent. Did that change? Was he wrong?

> *The evidence assembled to date suggests that the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA. Scientists theorize that in an era that predated Book of Mormon accounts, a relatively small group of people migrated from northeast Asia to the Americas by way of a land bridge that connected Siberia to Alaska. These people, scientists say, spread rapidly to fill North and South America and were likely the primary ancestors of modern American Indians.*

## Godhead

>_**38** Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?_
>
>_**39** And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;_

[Alma 11:38-39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p38-p39#p38)

&nbsp;

> _**1** And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye should understand that God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people._
>
> **_2** And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father, being the Father and the Son –_
>
> **_3** The Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son –_
>
> _**4** And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth._

[Mosiah 15:1-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)

&nbsp;

>_**14** Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters._
>
>_**15** And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image._

[Ether 3:14-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)

&nbsp;

>_**15** “Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father. Amen.”_

[Mosiah 16:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)

&nbsp;

Assuming the 1838 version of the first vision was the truthful one, why would Joseph have a Trinitarian view of the Godhead if he personally saw God the Father and Jesus Christ as separate, distinct beings before writing the BoM?

One could make the argument that this account was written 8 years after the 1830 print of the BoM…

## Enumeration of Changes
After some internet scrounging, I've encountered a useful comparison of Book of Mormon editions, found [here in Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qf2k47w5oicbdrd/AAAeB9BzoFLd4UV-CUN0RObha?e=2&dl=0). I've saved a local copy, in case this link does dark for whatever reason.

It looks to be the work of one [/u/spencecopper](https://www.reddit.com/user/spencecopper), so shoutout to him for putting it together.

Here are some notes from [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6xhc2w/book_of_mormon_changes_text_files_to_compare_it/):
>[I] was able to get a text copy of the 1830's version (from the [Joseph Smith Papers Project](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/1#full-transcript)) and with a fairly simple algorithm it separated it into verses leaving only a few hundred for me to check manually.
>
>I've included the raw text of the 1830's and current version, as well as 4 different version's for easier viewing:
>
>- There is the full version which includes all changes, including punctuation.
>- A version which shows words that have changed but ignores capitalization and punctuation.
>- Two versions where it only shows the major changes, one with the full BoM text and the other with only the verses with major changes. Major changes count as something which is 57 % or less similar to each other. And it also ignores several of the favorite changes such as **is** changed to **are**, etc.
> 
> Deletions are highlighted in RED and additions are highlighted in BLUE.
> 
> Feel free to draw what conclusions you want yourself. ==There is about 16k changes== from the 1830's to current version. ==Most of this is spelling, grammatical, punctuation, capitalization, and word choice.== Some of these could have been introduced by the printer, a lot of them seem to be introduced by someone who wasn't a very good writer. Skimming the changes really gives you a sense of how even poorer written it was when it was first published. A lot has been changed as to not trigger a grammar Nazi into a fit of rage. For example if you though "and it came to pass" was repetitive now, so did someone else and they removed 40 of those instances.

The Dropbox folder has some docx, pdf, featuring the highlighted changes, and txt files with the raw, unformatted contents.

I popped those raw texts into [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/download), since it allowed for more flexible comparisons, such as ignoring case. (e.g. "And it came to pass" vs "and it came to pass" syntactically does count as a change, but practically I find those inconsequential.)

Once I spend more time of the comparison, I'll look for a way to [[TODO#Functional|share my findings here]]. Meanwhile, you now have the same links I do.
